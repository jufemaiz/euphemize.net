Argh...

So it finally happened. I get home today, and the good old boys in (partial) blue have sent me my notice. I'm officially required to head on down to the Downing Centre District Courthouse to undertake potential Jury Service in a criminal trial (that's if I'm selected). Only problem is that the day I'm required to be there, I'm spontaneously meant to be at the <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au">University of New South Wales</a> doing a presentation for High Efficiency Solar Cells (Postgraduate subject) on ALICIA solar cell technologies. Problem is that even if I'm NOT selected, I can't do it the week after (not to mention that I have other presentations due to be done that week) or the week after that due to the fact that the lecturers and tutorers who are marking will be heading off overseas to a conference. Great!

So now its time to write a nasty letter off to the sherrifs office in the hope that I may be excused. I am after all paying for the privilege of the course to the tune of over $AU2000 and it is only run once every two or three years...
