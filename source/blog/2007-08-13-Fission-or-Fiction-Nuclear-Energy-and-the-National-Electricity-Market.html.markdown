I've watched the last years worth of talk, talk and more talk about the potential of nuclear energy. Even amongst the more informed groups there appears to be a large section of the subject being ignored - and one which will have a significant impact on governments at all levels and the public if ignored. Additionally, I've been asked quite a bit of my thoughts on the option of nuclear energy.
<h3>About Me</h3>
I'll declare right now that I have studied renewable energy engineering, to ensure readers are informed (even though I'm pretty sure there won't be too many readers of this) of my background. I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree (Class I Honours) in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy. Additionally I also have a Masters of Engineering Science in Electrical Power. Both these degrees were obtained from the University of New South Wales in Australia.

In light of the move towards a nuclear option for Australia's electricity industry by John Howard it is important that the public comprehend the realities of this option. While many Australians still believe that the electricity system is owned, maintained and supplied by the old vertically integrated monopolies that brought electricity to the far reaches of the country, the industry has long since moved on. The National Electricity Market was an outcome of the Industry Commission's report in the early 1990's recommending the disaggregation of the vertically owned monopolies. NEMMCO, the National Electricity Market Management Company, was established in 1996 to establish, operate and administer the NEM. Since that time NEMMCO has come to include all eastern seaboard states and territories plus South Australia, leaving only Western Australia and the Northern Territory outside of control.
