I never though I would have to admit to this, but it appears that australia beers are becoming soft... The Good Living section of the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au">Sydney Morning Herald</a> claims that the <a href="http://smh.com.au/articles/2005/02/07/1107625131613.html">bitterness of beer is leaving australian beers</a>.

I think it's time that Sam Kekovich, famous amongst ABC viewers from <a href="http://abc.net.au/thefat/">The Fat</a> whilst it was on the ABC (before shipping off to a commercial network, where it subsequently died in the arse) and more recently from the Australian Lamb campaign for Australia Day:
<blockquote><a href="http://smh.com.au/news/National/Kekovich-lambasting-to-stay-on-airs/2005/01/18/1105810904041.html">No. They were thinking of grabbing a lamb chop off the barbie with their bare fingers, sustaining third degree burns, then sticking their hands in a relieving esky to fish out a cold one (referring to ANZAC's fighting for "tofu sausages")</a>.</blockquote>
So to all Australian beer drinkers, follow the advice from the Beer Lovers, and drink any of the following beers (all of which I highly rate):

	<li>Pale Ale</li>
	<li>Pilsner</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.malt-shovel.com.au/">James Squire</a>

	<li>Original Pilsener</li>
	<li>India Pale Ale</li>
</ol>
