Just recently caught wind of this one. <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> is a renowned stirrer of the web world with their web application, with previous versions being declared "alpha", "beta" and "gamma".

Now, paying homage (or paying out) the "Jesus loves you" movement from Christendom the flickr crew have declared that they too love you!
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://flickr.com"><img src="http://l.yimg.com/www.flickr.com/images/flickr_logo_gamma.gif.v1.5.7" alt="flickr loves you" /></a></p>
I'm just awaiting the inevitable howls of protest from the various groups that believe that they own it.

Another classic example of their cheeky nature is in their error messages (which most web2.0 companies seem to have to make light of an error):
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/527172663/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/220/527172663_7163963c79.jpg" alt="Flickr - Hickup" height="398" width="500" /></a></p>
At least it brightens up a potentially embarrassing moment a little.
