Last month I somehow had multiple links from adult sites... Now I've got one that is a little more substantial...

<a href="http://blog.fawny.org/">Le Fawny Blog</a> has a list of information on accessibility articles, and <a href="http://blog.fawny.org/2005/06/15/b-links/">I managed to get a listing</a> for my little writing on <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2005/03/06/and-so-it-begins/">a sydney morning herald article regarding web accessibility and the Victorian Government</a> (never published online)...

Just something random for the day... that is all...
