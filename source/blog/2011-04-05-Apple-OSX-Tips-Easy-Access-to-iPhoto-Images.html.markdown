Quite often I find myself needing to easily access iPhoto images and a friend recently asked the question:

<blockquote>I bought an external hard drive to back up movies and music – I was wondering how you made that short cut to the i-photo library when you set up the lap tom the first time? Thus far I haven’t been able to work out how you did it!</blockquote>

So here's the steps.
<ul>
	<li>Right click on the "<strong>iPhoto Library</strong>" icon in your "<strong>Pictures</strong>" folder;</li>
	<li>
		<em>Show package contents</em>;

	</li>
	<li>In new folder, right click on "<strong>Originals</strong>" and <em>Make Alias</em>;</li>
	<li>
		In new folder, right click on "<strong>Modified</strong>" and <em>Make Alias</em>;
		<a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2011-04-05-at-9.49.59-AM.png"><img src="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2011-04-05-at-9.49.59-AM.png" alt="iPhoto » Create Alias" title="iPhoto » Create Alias" width="437" height="623" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-662" /></a>
	</li>
	<li>
		Drag and drop those "<strong>alias</strong>" files to your "<strong>Pictures</strong>" folder.

	</li>
</ul>

<h3>A note for backups</h3>
If you are looking to backup the whole "<strong>iPhoto Library</strong>" folder, copying this will ensure you also back up not only the  originals and modified files but also all the meta data.
