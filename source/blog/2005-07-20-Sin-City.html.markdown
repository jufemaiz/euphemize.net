Saw it tonight - it's really good. Sure there's the violence, but somewhat reminiscent of Kill Bill, it appears very cartoony - staying true to the comical nature of the roots.

While it would appear that a plotline does not exist, it's mainly because it is designed much like a comic book - seperate but interwoven stories.

Off topic - who would have thought that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088127/">Alexis Bledel</a> was 23 given her role in the Gilmore Girls. Certainly grew up fast in this movie... and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000704/">Elijah Wood</a> gives his scariest role to date as a cannibal...
