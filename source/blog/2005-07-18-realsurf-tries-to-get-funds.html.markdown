So <a href="http://www.realsurf.com">realsurf</a> is trying to gain a bit of extra funding, which is fair enough. However, I would have to say that their 'Black Page of Doom' isn't working the way that they expected. I get stuck on the refresh and never get into their content pages (as they say I can)...

For those who want in, <a href="http://www.realsurf.com/index.php">just use this link</a>

...and for the guys at realsurf - please get someone professional to do a redesign and website overhaul. <a href="http://www.coastalwatch.com">Coastalwatch</a> did and it's done wonders for them. No wonder people are turning to them.
