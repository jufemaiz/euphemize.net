I really miss my cat being away from home. I spent so many exams with her curled up around my shoulders while I was studying. As much as I love my pup, I'm a cat person through and through.

This is meg. She's pretty. She's not terribly bright, unlike our past cats, but she doesn't think she needs the brains anyhow.
