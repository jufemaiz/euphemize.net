A session with Stephanie Bendixsen. Just a bit of fun really and was originally aimed at providing some portfolio shots for a job interview with ABC3.

Guess it must have worked - Steph is now the cohost of <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/">Good Games</a> on ABC.

Since picking up the gig, the four shots I posted (plus her extended collection on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/just_surreal/tags/joelcourtney/">her flickr stream</a>) seem to have become exceedingly popular.

Further photo after the break, or check out the full set <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157621076377034/">online at flickr</a>.
