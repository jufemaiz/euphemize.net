Arrived New Years Day and met Anneloues from work (at the mighty mart) who had managed to score some free accomodation for us with her (second) cousin, who lives here. Grabbed a tram and a short walk (not far from the center for town) and we had arrived. Had a relaxing day with a cup of tea, caught up on the news, went out for a short walk around the canals and finally dinner at a small pizzeria. Also met my kind host, Tim, when he got home from a trip to Norway for NYE/Christmas. He's an aussie, with dutch heritage like Anne, who after working in Australia decided to stretch his legs.

Next day we headed to the Rijksmuseum and some wandering around the streets. Found a nice cafe and had a pea soup (more pea + ham soup, but just called pea soup... anne tells me it's a national dish, though she made sure i was the guinea pig as to the quality of this restaurants). After the day out on the street Tim took us out to a barbeque restaurant for a fantastic meal.

3rd saw us playing around at the Van Gogh museum, Ould Kirke and Anne Frankhuis. The day was capped of with a night out to aid the celebrations of Tim's flatmate's birthday (and to watch the soccer too).

The fourth and I was saying goodbye after grabbing some stroopwafels (very tastey), fruit and a couple of croissants for a six hour train ride to Berlin where I am currently sitting atm.

Hope all's well in Australia, that the day at the cricket was fun. Hoping to put some more pics up when I fined a cafe with USB access...

Ciao
