I went down to Long Reef on Sunday to shoot one of Hannah's friend, Bec Twist's, families down amongst the dunes. Originally we were concerned about the weather, but that turned out not to be a problem, except for the thick blanket of cloud.

I don't yet have any of the photos that will be printed for the Twists, however I've put up some of the landscape shots I took while down there, including a couple of panoramics.
