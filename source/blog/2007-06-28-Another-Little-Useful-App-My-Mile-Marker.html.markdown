The team at <a href="http://sidebarcreative.com/" title="Sidebar Creative = &lt;3">Sidebar Creative</a> have come up with a genuinely useful little app - <a href="http://mymilemarker.com/" title="Track your vehicle(s) km and fuel consumption :D">My Mile Marker</a>. To date I've been using (rather unsuccessfully) my little moleskin diary to record the fuel purchases ($ and L) and odometer reading, and have on occasion put it into a spreadsheet (call me a geek, whatever). What this lovely little application  does is takes your odometer reading, the fuel purchased and the price (per unit, be that litres or gallons) and records it (yay - I can go through the moleskin + receipts and put it all in there o=) ). You then get some lovely graphs showing the historical data and further more takes some basic steps to project future usage.

More to come when I get more data in to show the graphing capabilities.

Went through the receipts and numbers I'd written down from odometer readings at tank fills (mind you, I'm missing a three month gap from the end of January to May... doh!). The graphing seems a bit buggy at the moment, not sure why that is - might take a peek at the <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> to check what's going into the graphs. The graphs themselves are hot - something I'm looking at right now with a project I'm playing with - though the second graph is buggy as all hell (bug noted and filed with the guys in their development forum).
