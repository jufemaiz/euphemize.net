As you can tell, I spend a little bit of time each day at a site called <a href="http://www.aquabumps.com/">aquabumps</a>. Run out of Bondi by a guy called "Uge" (he's a little mysterious). The site has now been updated so that you can order prints of the daily surf reports. Neat little addition and a must see site for those who love water.
