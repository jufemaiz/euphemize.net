<p>I can't post the shots from this shoot unfortunately, but I can show you this one which I absolutely love. My sisters have been dancing at Jenny's school for over twenty years and I've been to all but a handful of concerts. Throughout the last decade or so I've spent my time acting as lighting or sound technician, stage manager or runner at the annual end of year concerts. While I brought my camera in 2007 to shoot my sister's dance, Jenny brought me back this year to shoot the show from the wings. Luckily she was more than pleased with the results that have been collated into a book and is on display at the school.</p>
