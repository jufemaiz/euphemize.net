So after Mr Costello decided to stake his "<em>conomic credibility on his claim to have found a $700 million "black hole" in the way Labor had accounted for the low income tax offset that it proposes to replace with its working tax bonus</em>" <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/07/1097089499365.html" title="Treasury backs Labor's tax costings">Treasury backs Labor's tax costings</a>. Undoubtably interesting.

<blockquote>The federal Treasury has backed the costings of the main plank of Labor's tax package, contradicting a claim by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, that the Opposition's plan had a $700 million error.
...
Treasury estimated the cost to be about $2.5 billion a year - even less than Labor's estimate.</blockquote>

So treasury has come out and said that Labor has been too conservative in their estimates of promises, despite insistences by our caretaker PM and offsiders that they were undertarget. But then again, with people so stupid as to not understand that the economists have forecasted that interests rates will stay the same under either government, I'm highly doubtful of a victory by Labor. So back to Howard's lying for another 3 odd years. Who's up for a move to Sweden?
