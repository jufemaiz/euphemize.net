I was invited down to <a href="http://sydneyoperahouse.com/thestudio">The Studio at Sydney Opera House</a> to shoot for <a href="http://thesydneysocial.com">The Sydney Social</a> at the start of September.

Was a bit weird shooting a piece of live music that was being recorded for television (courtesy of <a href="http://maxtv.com.au/Max/Sessions.aspx">MAX Sessions</a>), but definitely an enjoyable experience. Faulkner was great too, very much at ease despite what his sister told me (something along the lines of &quot;very *very* nervous&quot; as it was his major goal for the tour to play at the Sydney Opera House). Keep an eye out on October 4 for the show.

More shots after the break, at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157607073505989/">flickr</a> or at <a href="http://www.thesydneysocial.com/Photo_Galleries/Newton_Faulkner/">The Sydney Social</a>.
