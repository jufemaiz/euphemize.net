<blockquote>Joel,
Section 16 of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 (the Act) prescribes the elements of the DPS.   Subsection 16 (2) provides that the offences that attract 12 or more demerit points must be committed within a 3-year period of each other before licence suspension can be imposed.  Subsection 16 (3) provides that offences can be considered too old to contribute to suspension.  Whilst no specific time is provided in subsection 16 (3), by policy, the RTA considers it unreasonable to consider any offences that are more than 40 months old.

In very simple terms, the RTA will only consider the demerit points for offences that are not more than 40 months old (in compliance with subsection 16 (3)).  In considering only the offences that are not more than 40 months old, suspension will be applied if 12 or more demerit points are accrued and the offences have been committed within 3 years of each other (in compliance with subsection 16 (2)).

The adoption of a 40-month rule is considered reasonable as it ensures only recently committed and therefore, relevant offences contribute to licence suspension.  An alternative was to adopt a 6 or 10 year rule for considering offences too old but this would have introduced a harsher scheme and was seen as unreasonable.

If a licence holder seeks information about the number of demerit points recorded on his or her driving record, the information given will be based on the provisions of subsection 16 (3).  Only the details of offences that are not more than 40 months will be given because the demerit points for these offences continue to have the potential to contribute to a demerit point suspension.

This information is broadly published in RTA brochures and on its website and the RTAâ€™s on-line demerit points enquiry facility also reflects this position.  It is important to note that information provided via these means is limited in its content and intended as an overview.
