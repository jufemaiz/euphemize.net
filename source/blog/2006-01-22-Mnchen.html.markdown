So tonight my whirlwind stay in MÃ¼nchen comes to an end. I arrived late on the 19th and headed out to the Deutches Museum - an engineers paradise, especially with the amount of pubs around it! That night ran into Jane + Shane who I had met in Dresden, so subsequently went out to celebrate their last night in MÃ¼nchen. Happy hours at the bars are great!

Yesterday I went out to the castles near FÃ¼ssen - Castles Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau. Amaying location, with over a metre of snow on the side of the road! It was magical to see the place in winter, though I was slightly annoyed that Mary's Bridge was closed (snowed in). Gives the best views of the castle itself.

Today I went for a general look around the centre of MÃ¼nchen before heading out of the city to the site of the Nazi's first concentration camp at Dachau. Haunting and silent. Unbelievable what humans are capable of doing to their own kin. Not done for the "fun" of it, but very much worthwhile location to visit.

Tomorrow I am off for Switzerland. First to Vevey, near Montreux to take in the Lake and the surrounds. Then off to Gryon in the alps for a few days skiing! :D The hostel/lodge is run by a swiss-australian couple so I am hoping that they'll be doing something for Australia Day. From there it's to Paris to conclude the trip. Almost over, hard to believe. Anyhow, till I put some photos up I hope you're enjoying the ones I was able to upload.
