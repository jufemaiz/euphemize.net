Sydney played host to some of the largest waves seen in a while (some media organisations describing it as biggest in 30 years, while some surfers disagreed, possibly because of the mess that the surf was in at most locations).

Went out with my mates (many an avid surfer) - Tom, Tony, Foster, Mike, Drew and Toby. First stop was Collaroy, where I must admit I had never seen it bigger than I saw yesterday. The guys had a look, thought it was ok, but admittedly rather messy, so the call was made to head down to the bottom end of the peninsula to Manly to check out Fairy Bower and Deadman's Point. Having driven all the way down, and walked around from Manly to Shelly Beach, it was decided that while the surf was smaller it appeared to be cleaner so the guys paddled out. Not sure how many other locations there were available on the beaches since you really needed a protected southern area to get the best waves - hence Collaroy and the Bower were great.

Deadman's point was the pick for photos - and there were a few good surfers out there (including one little guy that was making some ballsy runs), a video guy in the water and a photographer on one of the two jet skis out there.
