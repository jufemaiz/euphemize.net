<a href="http://steven-foster.id.au">Steven Foster</a>

Of the couple of sites under development at the moment is one for a mate of mine, Steven Foster. He's currently over in the States before heading off to the UK/Europe. Since he's scored a lovely Canon IXUS from his mum and step-father, I offered to create a location for him to write us stories and add images. It's not completed yet due to some problems associated with textpattern (and through lack of time).

The design is kind of inspired by the postcards of the 50's and 60's, using a slightly washed palette of blue, red and cream. The front page has the most recent 'postcard' (or entry, using an image to add to the postcard feeling, though I need to make a generic 'I'm overseas' card, possibly based on an old photo of an airport/plane to keep with the feeling).

Below this is a set of the past postcards (smaller of course, since the focus of the front page is the most recent message) and the menu. Haven't really touched the menu, since more work has been put into getting the rest working well, and now just have to get the comment system working and it'll be almost complete - hooray!.
