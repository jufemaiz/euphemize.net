Trawling the web, as I do, I've come across <a href="http://www.defunker.com/">defunker</a>. From the guys who brought you <a href="http://www.bustedtees.com/">Busted Tees</a> they've got some great stuff. I assume that they won a few <a href="http://threadless.com/?streetteam=kvack">threadless</a> comps because some of the designs there have been on it (though sold out fairly quickly). Some cool shirts. That's all...
