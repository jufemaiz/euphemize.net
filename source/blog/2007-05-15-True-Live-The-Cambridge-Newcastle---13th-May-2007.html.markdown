The six piece hip-hop-jazz fusion <a href="http://truelive.com.au">True Live</a> rolled into Newcastle to play The Cambridge last Sunday night.

Supported by <a href="http://www.leftacenta.com/">Lefta Centa</a>, the night went off. The vocals of Ryan Ritchie were superb, never missing a beat, and the string section was fantastic (never seen an electronic cello) combined with a great keys player and backed by live drums.

I had the opportunity to shoot for <a href="http://www.inthemix.com.au">In the Mix</a> which is always fun!
