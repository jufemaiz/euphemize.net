Nestled up in the Swiss alps was the BEST hostel I had the experience to stay in over my trip around Europe. Well, I really should clarify this position. There was no bar. There was no fancy lock system. Nor were there any restaurants within sight. Instead what you got for your 17 Swiss Francs a night (less than $AU20) was a cosy chalet in the alps with a bunch of other very down to earth backpacking skiers or boarders. All food was cooked at the hostel which made for a great experience and well worth repeating in the future. The name: Martins Chalet - online @ <a href="http://gryon.com">gryon.com</a>.

So the first day I did the valley walk... In 3ft of snow! It was AWESOME! Like all aussies in snow, I had a ball even though all I was doing was walking around. Managed to find Villars, the village ~5km away that has the supermarkets, and do dinner/breakie shopping. As became evident there was a cycle in winter here - ski all day, shop on the way off the slopes, go home, cook, sleep, repeat. This I found out the next day.

After a good nights sleep I hit the slopes the next day. I cannot believe how much better the snow was than in the great land of Oz. It was like Thredbo after a blizzard up top - and apparently it wasn't great at the time I was there either! My three days went by quickly, and of the days that were suited to taking my camera gear up, it had to be confined to the first, and thus didn't happen (I could see myself stacking and breaking a few grand's worth of camera gear). My first day was spent with a bunch of rather arrogant Sydney private school boys who gloated about using their dad's credit card to pay for the trip, and as a result, I didn't mind when I lost them. Second and third days were with a great bunch of Scottish snowboarders (with me the lone skier). Absolutely awesome fun, and I didn't come away in the pain that I did at Perisher last year.

After one of the highlights of my trip I had to head off to my flight out of Paris and dinner with my mate Drew and his girlfriend, though far earlier than I suspect.

Oh yeah, one of the girls there also had a mathematical challenge that I haven't quite finished yet. For anyone interested:

Find the solutions for n the number of coins that can simultaneously be used to make either a square or regular hexagon - what are the number of coins in the side of the square, x, and hexagon, y?
