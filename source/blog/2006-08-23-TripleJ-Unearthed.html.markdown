In the finest tradition of playing big on a relatively small budget, the Australian National Youth Radio Station <a title="Triple J" href="http://triplej.net.au">Triple J</a> (a part of the <a href="http://abc.net.au">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>, not to be confused with the <a href="http://abc.com">American ABC</a>) is set to complement the likes of <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=music">MySpace music</a>, <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/">Pure Volume</a> and other similar sites aimed at breaking new ground for independent artists with the official launch of a dedicated site to their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unearthed">Triple J Unearthed</a> program.

Triple J Unearthed's original aims were to discover fresh new talent in rural and regional Australia. The original program went around the nation visiting towns where a transmitter was located. Soon this expanded into the major cities too. This first round of unearthed produced bands or groups such as:
<ul>
	<li>Grinspoon</li>
	<li>Endorphin</li>
	<li>Missy Higgins</li>
	<li>Killing Heidi</li>
</ul>
Soon the program was expanded to an annual state by state unearthing of talent. This year sees Triple J embracing technology and using a national approach via their new site: <a title="Triple J Unearthed" href="http://triplejunearthed.com">triplejunearthed.com</a>. Based around user uploads and allowing free access to songs by users around the world, triple j is hoping to unearth more new talent from this glorious land of ours.
