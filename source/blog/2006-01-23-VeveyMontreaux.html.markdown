With only a Sunday and Monday to spend in Vevey and Montreaux there was never going to be much to see. I arrived in Vevey at dusk and found almost all restaurants closed, so headed to the local "supermarket" (really no bigger than a corner shop) to grab some supplies (pasta + pasta sauce + parmesan) before heading back to the hostel kitchen to cook dinner. Quiet night ensued following the rather large one had the previous night in MÃ¼nchen.

Next day I attempted to visit the NestlÃ© food museum, but as with most things in Europe on Mondays, it was shut. I headed instead down to the ChÃ¢teau de Chillon near Montreaux - a large castle on Lake Geneva. Spent the day inside here and wandering around the shores of Lake Geneva, just chilling out, for the next day I was off to Gryon for three days of skiing and one of hiking around Villars.
