Incorporating the geo-blogging craze into flickr we now have flickr maps.

Check mine out (although you'll have to be signed in and a contact of mine) <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/map/">flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/map/</a>

<strong>Edit:</strong> After playing around around a little it has become strikingly obvious that Yahoo! cares far less about Australia than Google does (although Google is probably a little biased due to part of their maps programming team being based in Sydney). Thus the support for maps - both satellite and street directory style - is shocking for those of us down under. I've found the best way to use them is a combination of <a title="Google Maps" href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a>, <a title="whereis.com.au" href="http://whereis.com.au">whereis.com.au</a> and <a title="flickr" href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>.
