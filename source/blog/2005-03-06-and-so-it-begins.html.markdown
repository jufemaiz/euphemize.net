A warning on web pages has appeared in the Sun-Herald in Australia... (Though it wasn't deemed important enough to hit the <a title="Sydney Morning Herald" href="http://smh.com.au">smh.com.au</a> site...)
<blockquote><strong>Blind Rage Over Web Pages</strong>

Government departments are risking expensive legal action and being accused of discrimination by failing to make their web pages accessible to the blind.

Blind rights campaigners say more than half those websites operated by state and federal government departments contain content which breaches anti-discrimination laws because it cannot be easily read by 'screen readers' used by the visually impared.

A string of departments have been forced to update their sites after action or threatened action though (sic) the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission.

"You do have the expectation that the public sector is at the forefront of providing accessible services to the public," said Aileen McFadzean, from the lobby group Blind Citizens Australia. "It's disappointing that you are continually fighting a battle with them"</blockquote>
Don't say you have not been warned...
