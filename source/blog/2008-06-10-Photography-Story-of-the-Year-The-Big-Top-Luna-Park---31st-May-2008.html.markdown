<p style="text-align: center;"><small>Did you say jump? Story of the Year at The Big Top, Luna Park</small></p>

Shooting for the Newcastle street press Reverb Magazine I hit The Big Top at Luna Park on Saturday night for some hardcore/punk from the United States in the form of <a href="http://storyoftheyear.net">Story of the Year</a> with support from fellow Americans <a href="http://myspace.com/theaudition">The Audition</a> and local lads <a href="http://myspace.com/themissioninmotion">Mission in Motion</a>.

I wasn't sure what to expect to be perfectly honest - I'm more at home shooting the indie, soul, funk, drum n bass and just about any scene other than punk/metal/hardcore. Was pretty crazy having people being launched at you while in the pit, but I'd have to say that the security guys performed admirably and never really got annoyed at the crowd - hell, it's hard to do that when the head of security hasn't got a problem with the lead singer egging people on!

The lighting made things difficult to shoot, but I thought I came away with a few printables for the Newcastle mag I was shooting for. Unfortunately I hadn't managed to get anyone to come along who could string some words together - next time! One thing I would have to say is - all these guys love to spend half the gig in the air!
