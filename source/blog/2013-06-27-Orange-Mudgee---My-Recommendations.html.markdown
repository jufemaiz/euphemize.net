I met my wife when I headed to Orange to shoot <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157622195291462/">my friends' wedding in August 2009</a>. For nearly a year and a half I headed out to the central west two weekends in three (or thereabouts) and as a result had the opportunity to sample some fantastic food and wine in the region. I love the place - and have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/tags/orange">small archive of photos of the area too</a>.

With a mate's family property in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/tags/ilford">Ilford</a>, I've also spent a bit of time in Mudgee drinking wine and beer plus tasting the food of the area.

Often I've been asked about where people should go and why. My recommendation remains Orange (and surrounds) over Mudgee. I feel that you can do Mudgee in one weekend, but need a few more in Orange to really appreciate the area. Anyway, here's my recommendation for places to eat and drink and be merry.

<h2>Orange</h2>
<h3>Wine</h3>
The area boasts some of absolutely stunning wines that are yet to be truly appreciated on the national stage. Taste, like, buy would be my recommendation. Our favourite wineries of the area include:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.philipshaw.com.au/">Philip Shaw</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.brangayne.com/index.html">Brangayne</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mortimerswines.com.au/">Mortimers</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mayfieldvineyard.com/">Mayfield</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.smallacrescyder.com.au/">Small Acres Cyder</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Eating<strong> out</strong></h3>
Arriving early on a Saturday and after a coffee, hit up <a href="http://www.billsbeans.com.au/home.html">Bills Beans</a> on McLachlan Street on a Saturday morning - or their new large breakfast and lunch establishment Factory Espresso closer to town. Also, my former boss Adrian has informed me that the breaky rolls from <a href="http://byngstreet.com.au/">Byng Street Store</a> are a great option and worthy of a visit. Other good finds in the area include <a href="http://www.oldconvent.com.au/">The Old Convent</a> out in Borenore.

For an afternoon drink that will kick on to dinner, or a nice lunch with a splash of local wine, try <a href="http://www.unionbank.com.au/">The Union Bank</a> - <a href="http://belgravia.com.au/">Belgravia</a>'s own eating and drinking establishment, with a bottle shop (which doubles as their cellar door) attached stocking the best wine from the region and beyond (in case you missed a bottle or two).

For fine dining, hit up <a href="http://lolliredini.com.au/">Lolli Redini</a> for the top-of-the-class food in the region. Further fine dining can be had (and definitely enjoyed) at <a href="http://bistroceello.com.au/">Bistro Ceello</a> and <a href="http://www.racinerestaurant.com.au/">Racine Restaurant</a>.
<h3><strong>Food</strong> for<strong> Home</strong></h3>
Don't leave the area without heading to a few of the local stores to pick up some produce the area is renowned for. <a href="http://www.asliceoforange.com.au/">A Slice of Orange</a> in town, and <a href="http://www.totallylocal.com.au/">Totally Local</a> on the outskirts are worth a visit. As are the many orchards around the area. For those who love their pork products, the <a href="http://trunkey.com.au/">Trunkey Creek</a> bacon and pork products are stocked at both. Their chorizo and double smoked bacon are fantastic.

And if you miss out on one of the vineyards, chances are the bottle shop at the Rugby Hotel will have something to fill the gap.
<h2>Millthorpe</h2>
Just a fifteen minute drive out of Orange you're find Millthorpe - a cute little town with old bluestone buildings. Definitely consider staying here, the restaurant <a href="http://www.tonicmillthorpe.com.au/">Tonic</a> is great and means that you don't need to drive into Orange for a dinner out (but do book ahead).

The Old Mill is a fantastic spot to grab breakfast, lunch or a coffee and a treat during the day. Their lemon tarts are truly phenomenal.

<a href="http://www.angullong.com.au/">Angullong</a> also has their cellar door here - a fantastic little bluestone cottage (or possibly former stables) that is very cosy inside with a roaring fire (see above), very drinkable wines and lovely staff.
<h2>Mudgee</h2>
If you're really keen, head on up Mudgee road on the western side of Lithgow instead of out to Orange via Bathurst. Its a rougher ride, but still has some great options. My favourite winery out here is <a href="https://www.loganwines.com.au/">Logan Wines</a>.
