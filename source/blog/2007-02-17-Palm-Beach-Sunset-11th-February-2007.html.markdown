In a final hurrah before my beloved 20D went in for a clean (after over a year of putting up with dust) I headed up to Palm Beach in the afternoon last Sunday after seeing the (relatively) brand new Bond movie (and might I say it's good to see that they've taken him back to his roots, stripped back the gadgets, and given the movie a plot that involves characters) and coming out to a beautiful display of clouds.

<strong>Barrenjoey Lighthouse</strong>

Just to disappoint me, by the time I had hiked up to Barrenjoey Lighthouse, the thick pea-soup clouds had rolled across behind me blocking the potential for a phenomenal shot looking back over Pittwater with a firey sky. Instead, I had to "put up" with this.

Oh, and the upside of the cleaning of the sensor, apparently my 20D needed hardware upgrade, done for nix with a 6 month warranty at Canon headquarters near Macquarie Uni. They took the camera apart, did the upgrades and undertook a thorough clean, all for the sumly price of zip. Next one will be $50 though.

Anyhow, <a href="http://tropfest.com/">Tropfest</a> is on tomorrow and I'm hoping I don't get saturated <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2006/02/27/tropfest-2006/">like last year</a>.
