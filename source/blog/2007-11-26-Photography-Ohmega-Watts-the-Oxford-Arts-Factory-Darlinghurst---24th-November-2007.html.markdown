<p style="text-align: center;"><small>The man - Ohmega Watts - performing at the Oxford Art Factory in Darlinghurst</small></p>
I was once more invited by James Browning of Niche Productions to shoot one of their gigs - this time US hiphop artist <a href="http://www.ohmegawatts.com/">Ohmega Watts</a>, with support from New Zealand's <a href="http://myspace.com/ladi6">Ladi6</a>. It was a late gig, not kicking off till 9pm on the night of the Australian election (and by this stage it was an emphatic Labor victory - leading to the <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/09/12/john-winston-howard-and-the-liberal-leadership-succession/">leadership crises I speculated on</a> previously). The night had a great vibe, although the Coopers I had with a couple of mates wasn't quite quality leaving one of our team leaving for his nearby home after a single beer - it looked like mud, though we were duly replaced with fresh beers, didn't seem to help him.
