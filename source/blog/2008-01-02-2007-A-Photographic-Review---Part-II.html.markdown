<p style="text-align: center"><small>My Birthday Present to myself - my first L-Series lens from Canon, a 70-200mm f/2.8 from <a href="http://d-d-photographics.com.au/">d-d-photographics.com.au</a>. Also pictured are my <a href="http://moo.com">Moo</a> mini <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/tags/moominicards/">business cards</a> from England based on a selection of my flickr shots... they lasted all of 2.5 months</small></p>
July represented a ramp up in the hectic nature of my photography and life in general. I got to shoot a number of bands including: Something With Numbers at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600714568601/">University of Newcaste's Bar on the Hill</a> and 28 Days playing out at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601075872099/">Maitland</a>. A follow up to <a href="http://consulting.euphemize.net/mewfest-200704/">Mewfest:Easter 2007</a> was <a href="http://consulting.euphemize.net/mewfest/">Mewfest777:Winter 2007</a> to celebrate my 25th birthday. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600760270348/">Friends came up from Sydney, and also some of my Newcastle mates dropped in</a>, dropped down to Sydney for Sunny's 25th birthday bash, enjoyed the EnergyAustralia graduate dinner (after presenting during the day on our rotation), shooting some random work shots for the presentation, catching up with my Great Aunt who was down from Queensland with family and got some surf shots in to the bargain.

<h3><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/archives/date-taken/2007/08/">August</a></h3>
My final month in Newcastle was jam packed to say the least. On the band front I started with a friend from TheRoot42.org Ben van Grootel's band from Perth Streetlight <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601169327600/">hitting up Oxford Street's Spectrum</a> and finished shooting the Midnight Juggernaughts at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601787365543/">the Cambridge Hotel in Newcastle</a>. In between were the Kaiser Chiefs at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601252127382/">the Hordern Pavilion</a> (my first, and I finally met both <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/wr76/">Will Reichelt</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dreadfuldan/">Daniel Boud</a> both of whom I'd followed on <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> for some time), The Beautiful Girls playing Newcastle's Bar on the Hill and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601617732389/">the local band competition Resonate</a>. The month also saw a visit from Switzerland of a friend from <a href="http://www.theroot42.org/">TheRoot42.org</a> <a href="http://www.art.ificial.ch/">Thierry Blancpain</a>, a meetup of the Sydney members of TR42, the annual trip with the Manly High Guys to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601541165388/">Mike's Farm</a>, a lunar eclipse and packing up my room to head back to Sydney.

<h3><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/archives/date-taken/2007/09/">September</a></h3>
September started with two gigs in one day - the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601881544495/">Bimbadgen Blues Festival in the Hunter Valley</a> and Kora at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601896516976/">the Gaelic Club in Sydney</a>. I also had to move the majority of my belongings to Sydney and pack up my room. I'm a tad crazy! From there Sydney saw APEC come and go, along with the fence and the Chaser security penetration. A friend had started a new band so I volunteered to shoot them in at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602117261761/">the Hopetoun Hotel</a> and also shot the guys from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602219561878/">True Live once more</a>, this time at the Annandale Hotel, and Shapeshifter at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602250644787/">the Gaelic Club</a>. Work changed to Sydney with a new group and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601991056601/">I attended a conference too</a>. The move back home was interesting to say the least, and it's taken a while to get used to the bus travel once more.

<h3><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/archives/date-taken/2007/10/">October</a></h3>
October opened with a lovely night at the Vanguard to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602263160645/">shoot Hollie Smith</a> and closed with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602821061446/">the Annual PVSOC Dinner</a>. In between I had the opportunity to shoot <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602304181711/">Regurgitator at the Metro Theatre</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602425823220/">Urthboy, Hermitude + The Tongue at the Gaelic Club</a>, UK's <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602710521239/">The Klaxons at the Enmore Theatre</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602730663294/">Butterfingers at the Forum</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602731340764/">Vasco Era once again this time at the Annandale Hotel</a>. I also attended the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602298070285/">EA Staff Club Masquerade Ball</a>, a bit of a wander around the Rocks for a Beer Festival, one of Macquarie University's <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602737887274/">productions that Stu was playing piano in</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602754697901/">a roadtrip with the VeeDub Club to Bowral with Seb</a>. I was also involved in my first paid shoot - the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157602364472266/">media day of the Sydney Motor Show</a> for <a href="http://carsguide.com.au">CarsGuide.com.au</a>. October also saw me replace my trusty Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 with a Canon L-Series version as I'd slightly damaged the Sigma and it could no longer guarantee me quality images at the f/3.2 I normally shot at. As with the 70-200 I was suitably impressed by the quality of the glass - L-Series needs to be used to be believed!
