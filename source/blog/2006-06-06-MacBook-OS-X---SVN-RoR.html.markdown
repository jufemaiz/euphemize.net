Ok, so I've made the plunge. I've ordered my <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> books and stared at the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/tags/macbook/">blackbook</a>.

I've spent the night compiling from the source Ruby, Rails and Subversion. It's all in the planning phase of "the project" that myself and <a href="http://marsupialmusic.net/stu/">stu</a> are undertaking. Needless to say, we can't really go into details as to what exactly it entails, but it's going to be fun - and potentially tasty.

So what have I done... I followed <a href="http://hivelogic.com/">Hivelogic</a>'s most awesome tutorials:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/2005/12/01/ruby_rails_lighttpd_mysql_tiger">Compile Ruby On Rails</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/2006/04/19/svn_on_os_x">Compile Subversion</a></li>
</ul>
and also bookmarking <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">RubyOnRails</a> details about Subversion for RubyOnRails projects
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoUseRailsWithSubversion">How to Use Rails with Subversion</a></li>
</ul>
Thanks also to <a href="http://www.eganworks.com/">Liam Egan</a> for some tips on subversion.
