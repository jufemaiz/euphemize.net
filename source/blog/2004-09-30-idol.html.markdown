first there was music with "pop idol", "american idol" and "australian idol". now comes "priest idol".

The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/" title="BBC News">BBC</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3662074.stm" title="Priest Idol">reports</a> that the British television station Channel 4 has started work on what they will be calling <em>Priest Idol</em>.  The basis of the show will be that a vicar is given 12 months to increase attendance at a given congregation, able to spend an amount that is yet to be released to entice the congregation back in. What the hell are they thinking? I believe they've given up the christian part of church for the money. If it works, we'll have to see <em>if</em> the new flock end up in heaven or hell... It is noted that the Church of England doesn't quite agree with the concept's name:
<blockquote>We obviously need to see how the programme pans out, but for the moment we would like to see a better title, Priest Idol is too reminiscent of Pop Idol, and that wouldn't be a suitable format.</blockquote>
