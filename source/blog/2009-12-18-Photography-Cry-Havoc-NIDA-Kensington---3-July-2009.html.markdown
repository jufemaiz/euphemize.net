I was asked if I I could shoot a friend-of-a-friend's newly formed theatre group on a cold Friday night in July. Hell yeah I wanted to have a crack at it. It did however take a while for me to realise that one of the members I've known for years - being one of my sister Hannah's friends, <a href="http://www.cryhavoc.com.au/Revolution/Joanna.html">Joanne Erskine</a>.

Lighting, stylist, hair + makeup provided. Just be there to shoot with a few ideas based on some inspiration the group had taken from a variety of photography sources. The venue was deep in the dark caverns of <a href="http://nida.edu.au/">NIDA</a>.

To work with I had two small continuous lighting sources (erm, not sure what they were, I was a little distracted setting up, tearing down etc). One was used as a lightbox ~2m overhead and slight to the left, the second had barn doors attached to provide a small focused light source from behind.

This has been done more than a few times, however check the site, it works in quite well with some of their design work to date, so should be easily used on flyers and so forth.

Further photos after the break, or check out the full set <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157620901042944/">online at flickr</a>.
