A school friend of mine recently commented on my <a href="http://facebooke.com/jufemaiz">Facebook profile</a> in a response to <a href="http://www.energyaustralia.com.au/Common/Network-Supply-and-Services/About-our-network.aspx">EnergyAustralia</a>'s winning of the <a href="http://climatechange.gov.au/en/government/programs-and-rebates/smartgrid.aspx">Smart Grid, Smart City</a> project in Australia.

<blockquote> Joel, I would be very interested in your thoughts on a matter I have been pondering for a while now. I know along with Duncan your view differs to mine on what causes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Warming">global warming</a>, which is very different to human caused climate destruction, something I definitely agree is happening.

Understand that I totally agree that humans are having a destructive impact on the environment (so lets avoid an argument there on our differences in opinion on global warming).

I wanted to know from your perspective whether there is too much focus on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction as if you reduce CO<sub>2</sub> nothing else matters.

Could the way in which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/photovoltaics">PV Solar cells</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electric_cars">electric cars</a> and a whole host of other "environmentally friendly" products in fact be creating different problems in the future that are no better than the current ones?

For example over 90% of the rare earth elements such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lanthunum">lanthunum</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cerium">cerium</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niobium">niobium</a> etc are mined in China and from what I have read have had a terrible track record of environmental neglect to the point that the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2010-03/16/content_9597405.htm">Chinese Government has suspended all new Rare Earth Mine Applications until June 11</a> (which is more about propping up prices for these high demand resources than taking the environmental issue seriously).

I am sure there are many other examples of what I talk about here.

I profess to not know specifically what goes in to making a PV solar cell other than some of the chemicals involved are highly toxic from what I have read.

Are we as a society running the risk of focusing too much on reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at all costs to the point that it doesn't matter how much you destroy the environment in the process of achieving it?

I know what my view is but what Duncan clearly exposed when I tried to tackle the flouride debate was that I was completely out my depth and hence am asking you for your (and his if he is around) thoughts?

BRING ON TESLA'S <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy">ZERO POINT ENERGY</a>!!! (don't worry I know the existence of this technology remains a "conspiracy theory" and hence there is no pint debating it!)

What I didn't mention but I am sure you are aware of already is that rare earth elements are used in many things such as wind turbines, hybrid vehicles & batteries, solar energy technology, plasma screen tvs, iphones etc etc</blockquote>
