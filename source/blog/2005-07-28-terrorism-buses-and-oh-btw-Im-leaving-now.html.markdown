In case you haven't heard,<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/premier-shocks-party-by-retiring/2005/07/27/1122143910414.html">Bob Carr has resigned as the Premier of New South Wales</a> and wasn't it a shock move too... No one knew until it was said - not an inkling in the media about it.

I'll bet John Brogden is now licking his lips at the mere thought of the next election. We'll see how things pan out. For my money, I'd like to see Carl Scully be the next Labor leader for New South Wales.

<strong>Edit</strong>: Carl Scully was pipped at the post by Morris "Who-the-hell-is-he" Iemma.
