<a href="http://www.theshapeofdays.com/">The Shape of Days</a> is a US blog that I occasionally visit. Recently the site's owner Jeff <a href="http://www.theshapeofdays.com/2005/09/why_cutting_the.html">commented on the forecasted budget for 2006</a>. This is my response:
<blockquote>Can't agree more with you on either issue. Australia has seen the continual attack of Public Education and subsequent systems adopted that encourage parents to adopt for the high(er) fee private schools. Public education provides a bedrock for any society that wishes to be secular - since the mantra of such a system is inclusive rather than exclusive.

On the National Parks, this is an issue that many simple economists will be congratulating openly. Those, however, with more insight, will see that the positive externalities (or benefits) that a string of National Parks can provide to a community and nation are often those which are never accounted for in traditional business model economics that tend to drive a 'market system'.

Perhaps what could be put on the backburner for some time is some of the R+D undertaken by the military... Just a thought ;)</blockquote>
