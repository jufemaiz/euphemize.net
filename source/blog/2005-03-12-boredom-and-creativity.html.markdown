Well... as it happens, a while back a challenge was presented to me. A fellow photographer at <a href="http://somethingleet.com">somethingleet</a> put his new photography page up for us to 'ooh' and 'aah' over... I wasn't impressed... It utilised an old table structure and was poorely created (no offence <a href="http://konsolnet.com">konsol</a>).

So what else was I to do, but redesign it in xhtml/css...

Not only is the redesign both <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&uri=http%3A//euphemize.net/konsol/index.php">xhtml </a>and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?profile=css2&warning=2&uri=http%3A//euphemize.net/konsol/index.php">css</a> compliant (ignoring the extracss for his pretty scrollbars)... but also passes <a href="http://www.contentquality.com/mynewtester/cynthia.exe?rptmode=-1&url1=http%3A//euphemize.net/konsol/index.php">section 508</a> and <a href="http://www.contentquality.com/mynewtester/cynthia.exe?rptmode=2&url1=http%3A//euphemize.net/konsol/index.php">wai</a> accessibility standards...

New: <a href="http://euphemize.net/konsol/index.php">euphemize.net/konsol/</a>
