<p style="text-align: center"><small><a href="http://thebeautifulgirls.com/">The Beautiful Girls</a> touring to launch their new album <a href="http://amazon.com/Ziggurats-Beautiful-Girls/dp/B000Q36Y92">Ziggurats</a></small></p>
Touring Australia at the moment are <a href="http://thebeautifulgirls.com/">The Beautiful Girls</a>, with Australian blues singer-songwriter <a href="http://www.cwstoneking.com/">C.W.Stoneking</a>  in tow. <acronym title="The Beautiful Girls"><em>TBG</em></acronym> have definitely "hardened up" a little from their previous albums, going for a more rocky-reggae sound in most of the tracks. There is still a few older style blues and roots sounds to keep most people happy.

Gig wise, it was interesting. A Brisbane singer-songwriter came down to replace the missing Dutch connection <a href="http://www.luckyfonziii.com/">Lucky Fonz III</a> was up first, and for the life of me I cannot recall his name. <del>It may have been <em>Chris</em></del> <ins>It was <a href="http://myspace.com/christopherernst ">Christopher Ernst</a></ins>. Anyhow, it was a good warm up set and the crowd had begun to gather. <em>C.W. Stoneking</em> followed, and although the crowd loved the music, the lighting and his interaction with the crowd didn't summon the most visually entertaining of sets. Then the main event was on. Shooting was a major pain as the band decided that backlighting would be the go for the evening, and in the worst possible locations such that silhouettes were difficult to obtain. Anyhow, the gig itself was great, photos ok, and I grabbed a copy of the album before bailing home and must say it's become the latest roadtrip album for my regular weekend commutes between Newcastle and Sydney (of which only three weeks up here remain).
