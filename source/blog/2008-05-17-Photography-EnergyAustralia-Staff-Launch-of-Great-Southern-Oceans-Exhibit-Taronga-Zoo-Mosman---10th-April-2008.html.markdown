<p style="text-align: center;"><small>Looking back to Sydney's <abbr title="Central Business District">CBD</abbr> over the new Great Souther Oceans exhibit at Taronga Zoo</small></p>

I was asked by <a href="http://energy.com.au">work</a> to shoot the Staff launch day for the new Great Southern Oceans exhibit at Taronga Zoo. Was a nice evening and also ran into a few friends working for the event management company. They hadn't really though about the photographer's light requirements with this at all.

Unfortunately I can't show most - simply due to the fact that there are shots of children. So I'll show the non-children shots instead.
