Just thought I'd put a little respect out to a great bondi based photographer.

The commitment of this man can <strong>not</strong> be questioned as he gets up at 6am on almost every weekday morning before work to head down to Sydney's glorious Bondi Beach to do a spot of surf and landscape photography, with the results going up on his well visited website - <a href="http://www.aquabumps.com/">aquabumps</a>.

example of his work:

So go check it out - every morning if you can...
