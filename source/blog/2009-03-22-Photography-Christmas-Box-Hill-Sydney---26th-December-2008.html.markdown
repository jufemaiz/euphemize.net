Hanging around my second cousins kids has proven that I lost out in the looks department when it comes to my family's gene pool.

I still remember going up to McMaster's Beach on the Central Coast for Jess's father Paul's 21st. It was a &quot;P-party&quot; and it was the first time I got to sit at a bar and order a drink - I think I was about five or so at the time (very young whatever I was).

Makes me feel so old seeing the next generation on Mum's side of the family out. Sometimes I find myself looking around and wondering where the hell the time has gone and wondering where I'll be in another five years time.

Lachy's much more confident this year than in previous years - had lots of fun in front of the camera. Like his two sisters, Caitlyn and Jessica, he also shares the good looking family genes and long eyebrows + bright blue eyes.

I seem to get this look a lot.
