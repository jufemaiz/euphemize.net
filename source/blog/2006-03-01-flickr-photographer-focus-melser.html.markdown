As the first in what I hope to make a weekly posting I have selected a friend from the design forum <a href="http://theroot42.org">theroot42.org</a> - melser (aka Melissa or Mei Sha Sha).

Currently studying in China on exchange from her home at University of Texas, Austin in the states, she seems to be having a ball running over the Chinese countryside with her Canon 20D in her hands. Her photography is superb.

The guys and girls at <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> evidently agree as she has made the favourites page on <a href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/flickr/scout.php?username=melser&sort=date&year=0">many an occassion</a> (cheers to <a href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/">flagrantdisregard.com</a> for the use of their <a href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/flickr/">flickr toys</a>). Whilst her talents for photography are obvious it is her landscape photography that I find particularly captivating. These two from China are my favourites to date.
