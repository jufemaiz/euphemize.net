Right. I've decided to get serious about this rants page... It will shortly be upgraded to textpattern (a brilliant little CMS I stumbled upon recently). Well, just as soon as I work out a brilliant method to upload and organise images with. This may well see me write out a completely new plugin for the little program based upon my current site (but with a bit better management... and this one might actually see the light of day).

On the issue of the site - it needs a redesign. I'm not totally sure what I want, but I want it to be a little more fun and alot more user friendly. Possibly liquid design like the old kvack.inc site, but no tables. That's a prerequisite. XHTML1.1, CSS/DIV layout over tables and a kick arse gallery. At the same time, I'll be kick starting either joel-courtney.id.au or jc.id.au (if available) as my photography site. Since I've horded a mass of photos over the past three years shooting, and with a 20D soon to be added to the stable of cameras, I'll be needing a location to display the 'good shots' as opposed to the messy gallery structure I currently have. Again, I've got no idea what I'm going to be doing there.

In terms of blog layout, I need to have a location within to put the random sites I stumble across that I think are interesting or provide some insight into the world (be it engineering, web design, politics, photography or the price of fish in mongolia).
