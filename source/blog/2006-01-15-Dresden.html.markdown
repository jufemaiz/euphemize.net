Currently sitting in a little internet Cafe where I actually have USB access... So I got a few shots up... (Takes a bit of time to upload, so there's only ten or so :P)

Dresden is a really pretty city, but not really wanting to visit the miriad of museums, my two days have been rather relaxing. Also starting cooking for the first time. The first night I arrived two other aussies were staying in my room - Jane and Shane, students from Monash uni who'd done a summer course in Italy and were travelling around a bit after it... We decided a cook up was the way to go - so a stir fry was duly cooked and eaten, washed down by a few â‚¬0.60 beers from the local supermarket (and you get 8c back on them when you take them back too ;)). The pilsners around here are top quality, very much recommended...

Off to Bingen tomorrow to stay with the people mum stayed with in 2004 for a few nights before Munich, Fussen, Switzerland, Paris and home.

Until then, look at the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/1766440/">pretty pictures</a>.
