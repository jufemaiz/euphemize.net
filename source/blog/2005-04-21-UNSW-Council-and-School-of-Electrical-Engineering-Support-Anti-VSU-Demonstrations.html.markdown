I received the following email from the head of my school, the <a href="http://www.ee.unsw.edu.au">Schoolf of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications</a>, at the <a href="http://unsw.edu.au">University of New South Wales</a> Professor Branko Cellar:

<blockquote>FYI.

This is an extremely important issue and at the last Council meeting it was reported that the University was hiring a consultant to evaluate in detail the consequence of Voluntary Unionism in campus life and services. They are likely to be quite severe!

What was forwarded was a notice to staff from the Registrar and Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) of UNSW, Professor Robert King:

<blockquote>Dear Staff

The Federal Government has introduced a Bill into Parliament that if passed will make voluntary the payment of any Student Activity Fee.  The University believes that this proposed legislation will have a dire effect on the student organisations at UNSW, and as a result, campus life at
UNSW.

I state for you below, the University's position on VSU:

Resolved CL98/61 (1998)

Recognising the immense contribution of student organisations to the well-being of the University, that Council endorses the current arrangement at the University of New South Wales which provides for universal membership of student organisations and notes that this is broadly consistent with the policy of the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee.

Resolved CL03/86 (2003)

<ol>
	<li>That Council re-affirms resolution CL98/61.</li>
	<li>That Council give its in principle support to the UNSW Student Organisations in their campaign to oppose the introduction of Optional Membership of Student Organisations.</li>
</ol>


The student organisations at UNSW, the Student Guild, UNSW Union, Postgraduate Board, Sports Association and COFA Students Association are organising a "March against VSU" on Thursday 28 April 2005.  The day's events will commence at 12 noon on the Library Lawn with speakers. Shortly afterwards, free buses will transport students into the city for the march to the University of Sydney.

The "March against VSU" will be a focal point in the student campaign against VSU.  Therefore, I ask that staff do what they can to ensure that students who miss class as a result of attending this rally be exempt from academic penalty.

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely

Professor Robert King

Good to see these guys supporting the efforts to prevent the Coalition in Federal Parliament going nuts on their senate majority...
