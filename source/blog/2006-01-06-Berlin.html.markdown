Been in Berlin a little over 24hrs now and am staying at the location suggested to me by both Lonely Planet and Foster - the Circus Hostel in East Berlin. Best choice ever! Great little hostel and am enjoying it immensely. Today spent the day on a walking tour of the city for eight or so hours, seeing many of the sights by foot that I'd like to visit properly.

Anyhow, can't upload any photos here - no USB connection :( Instead onlz a short post...

I've also put a new photo set @ flickr <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/1766440/">Europe 2006</a> so that the photos are all together...

Got to dash... thought you might like this one from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/81154013/">Arc de Triumphe</a>
