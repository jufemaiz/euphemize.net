So, as ou can no doubt tell I'm having a slow night tonight. I should be writing a report on the operational issues faced by Independant Power Producers. Instead I'm trawling the web for watever gems I can come across, and one of the best tonight has been the site for the movie <a href="http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/hitchblog/blog.html">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>. So check it out - just whatever you do, don't press the red button...

just don't press it...
