Microsoft has just been nabbed by <a href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot.org</a> for use of pirated software. For a company that has made its CEO the second richest man on earth, you think that they could afford to pay for a few copies of <a href="http://mediasoftware.sonypictures.com/products/soundforgefamily.asp">Sound Forge</a>. Instead they have been caught using a hacked version. But does this make MS a hypocritical company. Well, according to an ethics lecture of mine - not if they do not believe that software should not be pirated (that is, you're not hypocritical if you continuously emphasise the illegality of software piracy whilst not believing in it - that's just simple deception).
