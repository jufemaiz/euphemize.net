A school has decided to demand that its students not publish any blogs on the internet as a method of 'protecting them from cyberpredators'. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/breaking/school-orders-students-to-remove-blogs/2005/10/27/1130367980065.html">Article @ smh.com.au on it</a>.

I wonder if they are also preventing them from living in the real world, using computers, telephones, reading books, talking to people, opening their eyes up and interacting with their environment...
