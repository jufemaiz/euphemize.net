The ever enterprising <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> is at it again with their newest toy - <a href="http://moon.google.com/">Google Moon</a>. Based on the same technology as <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> but looking at high resolution shots of the moon. Zoom in real close at Apollo 11's lunar landing site ;)
