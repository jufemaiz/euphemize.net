<p style="text-align: center"><small>The Kiwi Brothers + 1 token white guy of Kora hit Sydney Festival</small></p>
Catching up on the last month of photography. Kiwi band <a href="http://www.kora.co.nz/">Kora</a> hit Australia to play with the Sydney Festival this year. Performing at <a href="http://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/events/becks_festival_bar.htm">Becks Bar</a>, located at the Hyde Park Barracks Museum at the northern end of Hyde Park in the city, I was given an access all areas pass by James Browning (working for Sydney Festival, but also the man behind <a href="http://nicheproductions.com.au">Niche Productions</a>) and a couple of tickets - shooting the event for <a href="http://inthemix.com.au">InTheMix</a>. While I couldn't find anyone to enjoy the VIP tickets, I met up with Duncan and his brother Angus who were <a href="http://www.inthemix.com.au/events/reviews/36067/Beck%E2%80%99s_Festival_Bar_feat_Kora_Hyde_Park_Barracks_Sydney_190107">reviewing the show</a> for InTheMix and give a great wrap up of the evening's entertainment. The support acts that I got their to shoot were <a href="http://www.aloeblacc.com/">Aloe Blacc</a> and <a href="http://www.budspells.com/">Budspells</a>.
