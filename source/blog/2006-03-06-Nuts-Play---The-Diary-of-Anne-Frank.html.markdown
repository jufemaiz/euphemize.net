<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/tags/hannahcourtney/">My sister</a> was in <a href="http://nuts.org.au">NUTS</a> production of the play <em>The Diary of Anne Frank</em>. She played the slowly-going-crazy Margo Frank. Went along last Thursday to see the play and took my camera with me. These sorts of shoots definitely make me want a quieter shooting camera - the shutter sound of the 20D is just <strong>too loud</strong>. Anyhow got some shots for them. These are the colour ones but definitely looking to do some B+W variants:
