Wow - what a gig!

I was more than happy to throw my hat into the ring to shoot this gig for <a href="http://imwiththeband.com/">Reverb Street Press</a> in Newcastle and I wasn't disappointed. I'm a big fan of all of Conor's work - <a href="http://www.thisisbrighteyes.com/content/?cat=2">Bright Eyes</a> has been doing plenty of trips around on the music list and I've been loving what I've been hearing on his current outing with <a href="http://conoroberst.com">The Mystic Valley Band</a> - and the evening with him and his band live was an absolute gem.

For shooting, the lighting was good, but a bit patchy at the start compared to throughout the show. Once again I found myself wishing that I was either shooting the last three songs, or no song restrictions. Further irritating me where the number of people shooting with p+s's but leaving the flash on - note to all, don't use a flash at gigs, particularly if you're just grabbing a quick memento. It annoys the artists and doesn't actually throw far enough to be effective.

Unfortunately I was running a little late due to some domestic assistance I was attending to at my folks place, and hence missed <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/tags/ihearthiroshima">I Heart Hiroshima</a> at the beginning so apologies to them.

More shots after the break or <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157607730363293/">the full set at flickr</a>.
