<h3>The Commentary</h3>

It appears that more than ever the three words have been forgotten and that ANZAC Day is becoming more a piss up than a sombre remembrance of the futility of war and the loss of lives at the abject failure that is now known as ANZAC Cove.

I'm glad people have not forgotten the veterans, but I do wish that the day was spent in reflection on the current predicaments we have entangled ourselves in globally and ask whether or not we should be there. For it is as has been said:

<blockquote>Older men declare war, but it is the youth that must tfight and die</blockquote>

<blockquote>Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives... You are now lying in the soil of a friendly country, therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Jonnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side. Here in this country of ours... You, the mothers, who sent their sons from far away countries wipe away your tears. Your sons are now lying in our bossom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well.</blockquote>
