Privately I've been working on a few small sites. One is a spin off to a site I worked on earlier this year for the Architect/Industrial Designer Sally Dominguez. Originally I was commissioned to design a web site for the HOG Works products 'Waterhog' (later expanded to include 'Groundhog'). The specifications for the site were simple:

* targeted  at builders/renovators/architects, the site must have minimal navigation complexity
* fast loading (ie minimal size)
* accessible (to prevent potential legal action over access)

Whilst it's nothing groundbreaking in terms of looks (and please note that the footer change has not been completed pending a decision on how it should look from the client after the registration of the design and product name), it was exactly what they were after, especially with the recent conversion to Textpatten CMS. Sally approached me about a month ago when I was knocked about by what the doctors suspected was a gut infection and asked for a personal site. I immediately had this awesome idea of cards on a wooden floor. Sounds great - only thing is that due to Internet Explorer's less than adequate implementation of the PNG format (that is, completely ommitted by the idiotic programmers on the IE team, but loved by their IEmac/Office/macOffice/MSN/OS teams) it took a couple of days of intermittent searching to find a solution that works to some degree. The aim of the site is to have it implemented in textpattern, with some work still to be done on the 'About Sally' and 'Sally's Work' cards. There is also an option for future implentation of a blog section for her. Also, since the cards can be moved I want to add a 'jumble' and 'reorder' feature through a pull down tab in the top left - just for fun.
