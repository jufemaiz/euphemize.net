Try playing basketball with this opponent:

<a href="http://smh.com.au/ftimages/2005/08/03/1122748689906.html"><img src="http://smh.com.au/ffximage/2005/08/03/SNPbball_gallery__354x550,0.jpg" /></a>
It's not faked at all... The tall play is <a href="http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/margo_dydek/">Margo Dydek</a> standing at 7'2" over the shorter player <a href="http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/becky_hammon/">Becky Hammon</a> 5'6"...

More to come shortly on why mining trucks are not rally cars...
