<div class="caption">Juno @ Collaroy, NSW - 9 August, 2009</div>

Following on from the "babies" post (<a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2009/12/25/courtney-christmas-in-july-nowra-nsw/">Courtney Christmas @ Nowra, NSW</a>) earlier today, I introduce the next in the flickr requirement of "babies, and kittens, and sunsets" - kittens!

I had just picked up a <a href="">brand new lens</a> - the lens I coveted for years, used twice (at <a href="http://www.canon.com.au/en-AU/For-You/Camera-Lenses/Lenses/EF85mm-f12L-II-USM-Lens">a wedding</a> and in New Orleans thanks to <a href="http://rvt3.net">Richard</a>) and it was now mine! What better subject to test it on than a couple of restless kittens (of course) for John and Fiona. So here's Ziggy and Juno.

Further photo after the break, or check out the full set <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157621873839771/">online at flickr</a>.
