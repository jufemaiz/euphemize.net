My second time round in Paris, and I wasn't as keen as the first. Maybe it was the high of skiing in Switzerland, or perhaps the fact that I was soon to leave, but I really wasn't especially keen to do much. As a result I had dinner the day I arrived with <a href="http://thelyricalmadmen.com/txp/bios/drew-archer/">Drew</a> and his girlfriend.

Next day I headed out to the Palace of Versailles for the day. Astonishing place, and amazing to see just how much money was sunk by the aristocracy into buildings. My final full day in Paris was spent at Notre Dame, having not been able to climb it the first time round due to, of all things in Paris, SNOW! Great view, cool architecture, but nothing on the buildings of Prague.

Next it was the flight home, back to Sydney, with a stop off at Heathrow (London) and Changi (Singpore) before arriving to one of the hottest and most humid days of the summer.
