<p style="text-align: center"><small>The stunning Kathrin deBoer, singer for Belleruche</small></p>
I got in touch with the guys behind <a href="http://www.tru-thoughts.co.uk/">Tru Thoughts</a>, the record label with The Bamboos on their books, after talking to their web developer. Long story short, they use the <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/plugins/textpattern/jmc_event_manager/">event manager I created for Textpattern</a> on their site to <a href="http://www.tru-thoughts.co.uk/gigs">manage their artists' gigs</a>. They then asked if I'd come so to say hello and take some shots for them of their band <a href="http://belleruche.com/">Belleruche</a>. Was great to meet up with people who actually use some of your work in their business, and Belleruche was definitely a band worth catching. Their lead singer, Kathrin deBoer, is an absolute gem with such a powerful voice.

More shots + commentary after the break.
