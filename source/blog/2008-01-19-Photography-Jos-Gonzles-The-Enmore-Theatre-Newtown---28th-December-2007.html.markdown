<p style="text-align: center;"><small>The Enmore's information board - definitely the coolest around!</small></p>

My final gig for 2007, and what a year it's been (if you're bored I've split my review of 2007 into parts <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/12/27/2007-a-photographic-review-part-i/">I</a> and <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/01/02/2007-a-photographic-review-part-ii/">II</a> for a review with photography). Given that GonzÃ¡les is currently on high rotation on my iPod (all albums, not just the recent one), and my immediate fondness upon getting onto the viral spread of advertising for Sony's Bravia (before it was released as the advertising campaign for the LCD television series) I was ecstatic when I picked up this gig - even if most people I talked to about him had no idea who he was (for the record, my mum's more up to date than all those who weren't aware of who this Swedish singer-songwriter is). Support was from the talented soloist Emily Barker.

As an added bonus I finally met <a href="http://www.mulletgod.org/">Lucky</a> (aka Lakshal Perera) at this gig - with me shooting for <a href="http://fasterlouder.com.au">FasterLouder</a> and him picking up the gig for <a href="http://thedwarf.com.au">The Dwarf</a>. A great guy and was definitely good to have someone there to hang out with after our three songs were finished for both of the artists. Definitely was the best gig to round out a massive 2007 and entry to the contributory group of photographers that cover Sydney and Newcastle's live music scene - each and every weekend.

Anyhow, more shots after the break or at the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157603571466310/">full flickr set</a>.
