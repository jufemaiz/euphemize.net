Apologies for the delay, life took a bit of a fast forward this past week. No excuses though.

I got to shoot Central Coast band <a href="http://www.somethingwithnumbers.net/">Something With Numbers</a> with support from fellow coasters <a href="http://myspace.com/thelazys">The Lazy's </a> and Melbourne band <a href="http://myspace.com/theinches">The Inches</a> at Newcastle University's Bar On The Hill on the 6th July for local ezine I'm With The Band. This was also the first outing for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/706114648/">my new baby</a> - a Canon 70-200mm f/2.8 L series lens. My first splash out into the L series lenses, and I hate to say it won't be my last. The clarity of the glass is nothing short of superb, and worth every cent.

<p style="text-align: center;"><small>The waiting crowd. It took me 25 minutes to get from the gum tree not 25 metres away to where I took this shot.</small></p>
The gig itself was great, though poor management left people standing in a queue to get in for up to 45 minutes. Not a great way to start, and the organisers should really apologise to The Lazy's for the lack of crowd (I only got in at the last song, so very few shots of them at all). I was able to shoot upfront for all of The Inches set (which was great guys), but when Something With Numbers came on the photography pit at the front, well, disappeared under the surge of people. Note to Newcastle University: if you're going to put a crowd barricade up front, bold it to the stage so that it doesn't just get pushed all the way to the stage. Anyhow, these were the shots I managed to get (had some feedback from The Inches who really like what I got of them).
