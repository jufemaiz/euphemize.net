Sounds in the Grounds hit the University of Sydney's Manning Bar once again in October to please the listening tastes of most people. With acts including: Midnight Juggernauts, British India, Van She, Bluejuice, Lost Valentinos , Children Collide, [IS] and Numbers Radio there was something for everyone.

This is also the first festival (small as it may be) that I've had the privilege to shoot two years running. Compare what you see here with last years at <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/11/08/sounds-in-the-grounds-at-manning-bar-usyd/">euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/11/08/sounds-in-the-grounds-at-manning-bar-usyd/</a>.
