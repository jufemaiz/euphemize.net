UNSW's <a href="http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au">Faculty of the Built Environment</a> once again is hosting the Photography Exhibition as part of the course "Photography & the Built Environment".

Today was the opening night of the exhibition and I was disappointed that I was unable to attend. I was given instead a sneak preview of the exhibits by the lecturer Lisa Coleman. There are some standout pieces of work amongst the exhibition that need to be mentioned (note that this may be nearly half the exhibits):

<ul>
	<li><strong>Polly Pridey</strong> has undertaken a study of Sydney from the underbelly - the side of Sydney not often shown to the rest of the world via the glossy magazines. Mixing a sense of street press photography with some interesting subjects, the desaturated nature of most of her shtos makes sense.</li>
	<li><strong>Karlissa Kennedy</strong> has given an overview of grief, though I am not sure how much of it is close to home and how much is through interviews. The shots are exhibited in a small format of 2" x 1.5" with small paper cuttings of information of the people in shot. A rather moving selection of pieces.</li>
	<li><strong>Naomi Thomas</strong> looks into the aspects of city stories centered on Martin Place in Sydney's CBD. The hectic world falls away to reveal a more human face - love, loss, loneliness and friendship.</li>
	<li><strong>Alexandra Mount</strong>'s 310 hours explores Sydney in another way - setting photos at various times of the day to demonstrate how the city of Sydney is used at various times of the day. A winner with her arrangements that wrap around the boards.</li>
	<li>Finally <strong>Christel Chong</strong> looks at the humble barber. The quote used sums it up: "From businessmen to strippers, everyone needs a haircut".</li>
</ul>

So if you have time over the next week (I think it's a week) head on over to the Red Centre at the University of New South Wales (Kensington Campus) and check out a brilliant array of photography. If you can't, well, I'll put an advert for my stuff from last year - _Surfie Deadshit?_ - <a href="http://euphemize.net/photography/gallery/21/">Michael Dean</a> and Tom Chapman.
