<a href="http://waterhog.com.au/">Waterhog - Water Storage</a>

A site I have been working on has gone live. To be implemented in the longer term will be an ecommerce solution to enable online sales. The HOG's are designed by Sally Dominguez, and the company has been involved with the NSW Government's Year of the Built Environment through their Future Houses program - see them now at Circular Quay now!
