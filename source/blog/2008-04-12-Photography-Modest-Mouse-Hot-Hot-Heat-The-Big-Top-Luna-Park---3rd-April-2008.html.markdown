<p style="text-align: center;"><small>Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock kicks off the band's set at The Big Top, Luna Park</small></p>
I picked up the gig shooting <a href="http://modestmousemusic.com">Modest Mouse</a> + <a href="http://hothotheat.com">Hot Hot Heat</a> from Newcastle's <a href="http://withtheband.com.au">Reverb Street Press</a> after having my shots printed in it from Cypress Hill's gig at the Enmore Theatre (<a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/02/24/cypress-hill-at-the-enmore-theatre/">gig blogged here</a>). Was good to shoot something again as this year has seen very few gigs head my way unfortunately. Caught up with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/photo_assassins/">Anthony Yong</a> who was covering the event for 3D World and a girl whose name escapes me from Drum Media. The rest were either new faces I hadn't met yet or old faces I've not seen around the traps.

Personally I thought Modest Mouse was a little flat performance wise. Hot Hot Heat's lead man Steve Bays had the stage presence that Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock failed to capture. Maybe that is something that can be put down to lighting, but from a band with such a long history I expected more. It must be said that many of the cameras (my own included) focused on former Smith's guitarist Johnny Marr. All in all I think Hot Hot Heat proved themselves as a great live act while Modest Mouse seemed to be lacking a bit of energy - perhaps to be expected given the age of the members and that they were touring with the V Festival.

Anyhow, more shots after the break or <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157604411106113/detail/">see the full set on flickr</a>.
