<p style="text-align: center"><small>I believe that this is one of my best shots I've taken for a while - Sid O'Neil at the Annandale Hotel leading The Vasco Era</small></p>
Isn't it amazing what a lighting rig can do. I first shot guitar strumming Sid O'Neil, his bass playing brother Ted and drummer Michael Fitzgerald at a small pub in Newcastle around five months back (<a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/06/05/the-vasco-era-northern-star-hotel-newcastle-2nd-june-2007/">Photography: The Vasco Era @ Northern Star Hotel, Newcastle - 2nd June 2007</a> or the flickr set <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600300442438/detail/">The Vasco Era @ The Northern Star Hotel</a>) with a less than basic light set up. This time at the Annandale Hotel the lights were up, Sid's fingers were not bleeding (as far as I could see), the blood spatters on his guitars had been cleaned away and the music was classic Vasco Era goodness. These guys are just such a fantastic live act - I always have so much fun shooting them. I only wish I could have been around for <a href="http://www.thefumes.com.au">The Fumes</a> and the <a href="http://myspace.com/skybombers">Skybombers</a>, instead I was shooting the first gig of the night - <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/10/30/butterfingers-at-the-factory-theatre-enmore/">Butterfingers</a>.
