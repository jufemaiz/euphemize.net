Well, in my attempts to not <a href="http://euphemize.net/archives/20050621/two-down-two-to-go/">study for my exams</a> I have updated the <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress distribution</a> I'm running on this site. Whilst I think it works ok, it's not the greatest thing I've played with, and am still a big fan of <a href="http://textpattern.com">textpattern</a> which will be the engine behind this site in a bit...

One of the biggest problems for wordpress (imho) is the lack of full image support... Get that right, and they'll provide some more competition for <a href="http://textpattern.com">textpattern</a>
