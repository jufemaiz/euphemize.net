That haunting voice of Gollum's Song from the Lord of the Rings sountrack for number 3 (The King Returns) is back with a solo album. A folky collection of tunes that has a slightly melancholic feel to them lets us escape into what some people might term as the female Jack Johnson.

A good purchase ****
