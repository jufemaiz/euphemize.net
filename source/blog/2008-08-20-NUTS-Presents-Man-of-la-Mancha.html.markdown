Over the past few weeks I've swapped sleep time for what could be considered to be a second job. I've been doing all the design work for the musical my sister, Hannah, is directing. <a href="http://nuts.org.au"><acronym title="NewSouth University Theatre Society">NUTS</acronym></a> is putting on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_La_Mancha">Man of la Mancha</a>:
<blockquote>Thrust into the dark, damp and depressing dungeons of the terrifying Spanish Inquisition, a man is swooped upon by the desperate and violent prisoners. They rifle through his belongings and sadistically decide they might like to burn a heavy package they deem worthless â€“ just for fun. The prisoners set up a mock trial to decide the fate of the package, and the desperate man pleads his defence in the form of an entertainment. He draws on each of the prisoners to play the different parts within his tale of knights, chivalry, highborn ladies, romance and dreams.

The man is Cervantes and the tale is Don Quixote de la Mancha.</blockquote>
First performed in 1964, this musical drama offsets dark and brutal realism with song, joy, beauty and hope. It is always the darkest moments in human history that inspire the greatest hope.

Some might say I was crazy, others have said I'm too nice to my siblings, I just hope that those involved (including some of my mates who have been roped into being part of the band) like the output.
<h3>Cast Shots</h3>
I decided to take advantage of some new lighting equipment to undertake the cast shots for the show. Simple setup of a 580EXII into a shoot through umbrella in front and another 580EXII with a stofen omni-bounce diffuser behind to provide a halo catchlight. I learnt something very important during the shoot - bring a torch to assist with focusing. Here are my favourites.

<h3>Poster Design</h3>
Hannah basically gave me a blank sheet of paper as the brief. Armed with this I hit up flickr and Amazon for images of the area around la Mancha, the castle and also past imagery used. The silhouette seemed a popular one so I decided to integrate that in as a key element in the design. The windmill is a part of the story, and the castle is too. Originally Hannah thought belly dancers (another element of the story) should go where the trees are, but the detail would be too finicky. The landscape shots of the area showed beautiful changes in colour in the fields and occasional banks of trees such as that being used. The warping was added as part of the "dreamesque" environment in which the story is told.

The requirements for the text were fairly onerous - with the various contributors to the original musical and I'm happy that something that looked quite nice (if I do say so) came out of it. The logos could have been better to work with, but <em>c'est la vie</em>!
