My last full day in England was spent wandering around the Thames once more, a visit to Tate Modern and a tour of the Globe Theatre. It really was a leisurely day, not having to do much was great. Had lunch with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machhapuchhre/">Samantha</a>, a friend from High School, ran into a bunch of German skaters doing some photos and videos outside the Tate Modern and just did some basic exploration.

My last night was spent doing the menial task of washing and a night out on the town to catch up with Cord and her friends. All in all I think I got about 4 hours sleep as I woke the next morning early to get to Heathrow on the first Tube of the day to catch my 730am flight to the United States of America - entry point New York.
