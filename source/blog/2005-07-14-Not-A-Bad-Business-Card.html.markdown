Whilst at Semi-Permanent (Sydney) one of the speakers was showing his method of handing out business cards. Instead of a card, he had a sticker that was about the size of two business cards long but slightly thinner. When exchanging cards, he'd ask for two of the other persons, put his sticker on the second and hand it back. A pretty cool method.

Riding on the L90 bus into <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au">uni</a> I came across a similar calling card. A sticker for <a href="http://www.suwito.com.au">Suwito Design & Construction</a> was on the window (see dodgy camera phone pic below). The  question is - has it led to more business?
