In news from my <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au">university (UNSW)</a> I am having great difficulty in tranfering two of my fasttrack courses I completed as part of my BE(Photovoltaics and Solar Energy) to my planned Masters of Engineering Science. Apparently the administration staff at the school of electrictrical engineering and telecommunications haven't quite worked out the definition of "in good faith" and "communications". I'm really not happy with the services they have provided to me:
<ol>
	<li>Almost two months to obtain approval between the schools for the fasttrack MEngSc to be completed across schools</li>
	<li>Completion of BE only to find out that a $AU50 application fee (and associated application) had to be made for me to gain entry into a course I was already in</li>
	<li>Awaiting response from the various schools as to HOW the stuff ups occured and if I have been misled.</li>
</ol>

If I have to deal with stupid clowns like these again, I'm never going to do any further study at this uni, even though I really enjoyed the courses and friends made through the <a href="http://www.pv.unsw.edu.au/">Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering</a>...
