So it's a Tuesday night, two days into the exam period, and I've had my first two exams already.
<h4><a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2005/ELEC9240.html">ELEC9240 - Power Electronics</a></h4>
<h5>Monday 20th June, 2005 - 1345-1700 - Gallery, Squarehouse</h5>
So I had this exam yesterday. I had spent way too much time studying for it, at the expense of today's exam - main reason was I was scared that I may well fail this subject. So afer reading time commenced, the first error in the exam was discovered (I<sub>BLmax</sub> = I<sub>BLmax</sub> (1 - D) D). Then after a frustrating half an hour trying to make the the derivation fit what was given, we were told - "Sorry, correction. that D isn't meant to be there". Nice to see that A/Prof Rahman had time to ensure that the exam was proofed.

<h5>Tuesday 21st June, 2005 - 1345 - 1700 - Galaxy Room, Randwick Racecourse</h5>
Today's exam... I'm more worried now as to whether or not I'll pass this course. I enjoyed this more than power electronics, but it's the one I'm more worried about.

So, still to come:
