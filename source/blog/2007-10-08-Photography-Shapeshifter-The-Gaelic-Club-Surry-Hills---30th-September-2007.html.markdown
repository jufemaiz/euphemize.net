<p align="center"><small>30 second exposure of Foreign Dub Soundsystem at the Gaelic Club in Surry Hills</small></p>
The New Zealand Drum 'n' Bass band Shapeshifter hit the Australian shores for the Parklife festivals around the country and played a small sideshow in Sydney 4 hours after they went on stage at Parklife in Sydney (big night for them). Wasn't expecting them on so late, and ended up bailing earlier than I would have liked due to a splitting headache (with earplugs in the sound didn't make it worse mind). Was a rather fun gig too. Support was from Foreign Dub Soundsystem (who's singers were great). Enjoy.
