I managed to see some sneak previews for this advert a few months back, but couldn't find them again. Amazing shots of a mass of bouncy balls hurtling down a street in San Francisco. Luckily <a href="http://www.sony.com">sony</a> has put together a site with a little 'making of' to show that <span style="font-weight: bold">it was all real!</span>. Go check it out @ <a href="http://www.bravia-advert.com/">bravia-advert.com</a> - well worth a look.

Also worth a look is the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sepiatone/sets/720725/">flickr photo gallery for the advert</a>
