With an invitation from the manager of the Kaiser Chiefs' website for assistance with their gig guide (a custom version of the <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/plugins/textpattern/jmc_event_manager/">jmc_event_manager</a> for textpattern) I was able to head along to their Sydney show on the 5th of August to shoot for their site <a href="http://kaiserchiefs.co.uk">kaiserchiefs.co.uk</a>. Scored two tickets (so I could see the show itself) and a press pass, and took my climbing partner Alpha along - she'd spent a semester at Exeter and become a massive fan. The Hordern is a mammoth of music venues - the last time I was there was to see Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals play, supported by Katalyst and Jack Johnson, if I recall correctly. So with a packed audience of over five thousand people this is definitely the biggest gig I've ever shot.

To make the evening even better, I got to meet a photographer I've followed for some time and definitely admire for the quality of his work. <a href="http://boudist.com">Daniel Boud</a> is one of Australia's up and coming music photographers whose work is nothing short of excellent, so to be able to spend the show in the pit with him was fantastic (and he even <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dreadfuldan/1037279006/">managed to get a shot of me</a>). For those of you who don't know him, check out his <a href="http://boudist.com">website</a> and his <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dreadfuldan/">flickr stream</a>. In addition a fellow flickr member, and Brag photographer, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/wr76/">Will Reichelt</a> was present and was great to finally catch up with him too - having also followed his stream of shots with interest. Best part was both knew me - due to my prolific posting of comments on their photos, and the uniqueness of my nick on flickr - <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=jufemaiz">jufemaiz</a>. There was also a photographer working for an English magazine, and I apologise to her as her name escapes me at this stage. Was absolutely fantastic to meet you all - and yes, I do actually exist in real life (Dan had wondered if I was just a ghost).

Anyhow, without further ado, a selection of shots.
