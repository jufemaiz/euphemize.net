If you did, could you please come down to Nobby's Beach in Newcastle and pick it up. We're a little concerned about the litter situation around here - particularly the reports of 700 tonnes of heavy fuel and another 34 tonnes of diesel.

The storm  came in overnight and has pounded the coastline of Newcastle. In addition to the ship above another two are within one nautical mile of the coast. Most others that had been anchored at sea overnight shifted further offshore to try and prevent this from happening to them.

Hopefully this one will refloat out to sea.

<h3><ins>Update</ins></h3>
For those of you who missed it, Newcastle + the Hunter region have been buffeted by what some are claiming as the worst storms in over a decade (see <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/fears-ship-could-break-up/2007/06/08/1181089282623.html">SMH</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com.au/news?ned=au&amp;ncl=1117073055&amp;hl=en">Google</a> or even <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/06/08/attention-global-shipping-did-you-lose-a-boat/">my comment</a>).

I couldn't get home immediately tonight due to flooding in Newcastle, so instead I went to my second cousin's place (and got a beautiful dinner out of it - ta!).

On the way home I was greeted with one of the most eerie surrounds - cars dumped with hazard lights like in some sort of zombie or natural disaster movie.

After I got home I went out with my flatmate, Ben, and a friend of his to check out the little boat that could (beach itself like a whale).
