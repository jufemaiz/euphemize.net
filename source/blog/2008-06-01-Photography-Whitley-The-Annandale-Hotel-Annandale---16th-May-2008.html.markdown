<p style="text-align: center;"><small>Whitley rocks out The Annandale Hotel. Definitely think this is my best shot this year!</small></p>

Proving that an indie-folk singer can be a rock and roll superstar (or at least star) <a href="http://whitleymusic.com">Whitley</a> busted out some intelligent lighting and LED frames. The unfortunate aspect of the show was the fact that the place was so tightly packed that most of us couldn't even try to get in front to take some shots head on :(

Not sure how well thought through the lighting design was - it definitely needs some work. Music was ace though!

Also met one of the people taking over <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mattbooy/">Matt Booy</a>'s role as resident <a href="http://triplej.net.au">TripleJ</a> photographer (he's so good they needed a few people to replace him!).

Support was from <a href="http://howieday.com">Howie Day</a> (who calls the United States home) and fellow aussies <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Seagull">Seagull</a>.
