<p style="text-align: center;"><small>Part of my new roll...distribution monitoring!</small></p>

So another new phase in my life has come about with the start of March. Last year I ended up moving to <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/tag/newcastle/">Newcastle</a> for six months as part of the <a href="http://www.gradengineers.energyaustralia.com.au/">graduate engineering program</a>, this year it's into the city and taking up a permanent position at EnergyAustralia.

<h3>Moving Out</h3>
After six months back in Sydney, working as a graduate engineer for the Demand Management section. During this time I realised once again, after twelve months away from the city transport routes, just how bad <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/01/31/nsw-schools-go-back-and-sydney-gridlock-returns/">traveling from the Northern Beaches through Mosman to the city</a> each day is. Housesitting for both Seb at Dee Why in the lead up to New Years while he was visiting his family and girlfriend in Europe and then Stuart and Sarah's Haberfield house as they were on their Tasmanian honeymoon definitely woke me up to the fact that my bus travel time has definitely been way <strong>way</strong> too high.

Given that my high school mates weren't interested in a move out to the inner-west, I had to look further afield. There was originally an option from a friend-of-a-friend to move out to Zetland, however when Ben, my former flatmate from Newcastle, told me he was heading down to Sydney I decided to go with someone I knew. Originally I hit up the inspections around in the inner-west, however we soon had an offer that we couldn't pass up - a couple of rooms had become available in Surry Hills with some of Ben's friends from New College. With the option locked in, it took me a couple of weeks to move in - first getting the furniture I'd "stored" in Newcastle (<strong>*ahem*</strong> I kinda hadn't quite got back up there to pick my stuff up again<strong>*ahem*</strong>) moved in and then a week later moving myself in and setting up some semblance of a room.

<p style="text-align: center;"><small>My (new) room in Surry Hills</small></p>

One of the things I noted when I was packing my room up at my parents place in North Narrabeen to move out was that I'd misplaced one particular box that has a cable "cage" for tidying computer and electrical cables and the screws to join the desk to the frame - so currently it's an interesting arrangement. I should thank Stuart and Sarah for giving me a hand carting about half a tonne of books up two flights of stairs as my room is "in the attic" - but it's got a massive amount of room which is awesome. Only really need another bookshelf, probably one of ikea's <a href="http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/40047675">4x4 cube shelves</a>.

<h3>A New Position</h3>
To go with the new location for living, I also accepted an offer for a new position as Technology Analyst with the Intelligent Network Group at EnergyAustralia. Finally moving off the graduate program, some might consider my time about 7 months late as I was able to for that amount of time, and jumping very much into the deep end as I take on my new roll. To date it has been interesting, challenging and also quite exhausting but definitely enjoyable. Time will tell how I go, but within three weeks of starting I feel that I'm already making headway with the work I'm undertaking.

<h3>The New Life</h3>
So with a new place to live, now within walking distance from work, and a new position to throw myself at, the next six months will be hectic, intense but above all fun. I'll try and keep a few updates of life as I move through the different phases of work and contribute comments I can make on here.
