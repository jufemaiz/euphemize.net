<div class="note">
Sure this is late, but it's better than nothing.

So I turned 25. The quarter century. I don't really feel that old and it's kind of strange to think that I've been kicking around this sphere of dirt for a little over a quarter century. While it's nothing in the scheme of things (when compared to, say, the age of the earth) it's still got me thinking even more about my goals for my time here. Still working out exactly where I want to be in say ten years time, kind of know five, but less sure about 6 months/a year. Anyhow, for the fun stuff.

Awaiting for me at home after my almost weekly cruise down the F3 were a few packages on the weekend of my birthday. Both from the United Kingdom, the first was my very British lapel pin from <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Stuff &amp; Nonsense</a>. The second was my order of <a href="http://www.moo.com/">moo cards</a> to throw at promoters, bands and fans while I'm out shooting (in the hope of getting more gigs).

To celebrate the quarter century mark being reached (after not having a 21st due to the sheer volume of them combined with exam period) I held a small gathering up in Newcastle with friends. I was lucky enough to receive a copy of Simon Carter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-Climbing-Images-Simon-Carter/dp/097576621X">World Climbing: Images From The Edge</a> from Alpha, Jared, James and Lee (thanks guys :)), and a chocolate mouse from Stu and Sarah, plus the presence of close friends from Sydney and a few I'd made at work up here in Newcastle.

With eighteen months since my last major camera related purchase I decided I could now afford to buy the lens I'd been eyeing off for some time. So I've welcomed the 70-200mm f/2.8 L from Canon into my collection, and it's definitely become a favourite fast.

My new ring finally arrived in during the week of my birthday (shots to come, when I get around to playing with some sort of macro set up) after 2 years since I lost the one I got when I was sixteen and the family got me a new watch - a Nixon Player (silver face). Also got a few little extras like a mini slinky, Scrubs Season One (thanks Hannah), the movie The Prestige, the documentary on the restoration of the James Craig (my Uncle works on it as part of the <a href="http://www.australianheritagefleet.com.au/Index/index.html">Sydney Heritage Fleet</a> and I got to go out for a <a href="http://gallery.euphemize.net/photography/gallery/47/">day on it with Stu in 2004</a>).

Finally, with a print run of photos due to be made in the near future I'll have some swaps heading out around the world with mates so I'll have something to put on my walls by people other than myself :)
