<p>Haven't quite put the photos up (yeah, yeah - i'll get to it tomorrow), but after helping Beano with the sheep for shearing over the weekend I came to understand how stupid they are. HOWEVER, I didn't think that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=920398">they'd follow each other like lemmings off a cliff</a>.</p>
<p>I present Team Michy's Farm, 2005 (from left to right): Tom, Mike, Me, Nick, Shehadie, Charles, Seb, Jesse, Sunny, Drew, Stu and Richard.</p>
