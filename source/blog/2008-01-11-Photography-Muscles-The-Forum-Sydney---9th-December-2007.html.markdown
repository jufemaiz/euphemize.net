<p style="text-align: center"><small>A Shadowy Muscles at The Forum amongst the Neon Kids</small></p>
Getting my photography back up to date, next up was <a href="http://myspace.com/musclesmusic">Muscles</a> who was performing at The Forum in Sydney. This was a shoot for <a href="http://fasterlouder.com.au">FasterLouder</a> and was a pretty good night (even for a Sunday with a Monday at work afterwards). This was one of my first all ages gigs and all I can say is that kids have no idea how to act in a crowd. To make matters worse there was no barrier up in front of the stage to allow security to pluck those being squished out. Speaking to the Drum reviewer she said she couldn't believe it and that the crushing looked more like a rock/metal gig than an electro all-ages gig! Support was from the very able <a href="http://myspace.com/cassettekids">Cassette Kids</a>, who have since <a href="http://www.triplejunearthed.com/competitions/default.aspx?TripleJCompetitionId=62">won a spot at the Big Day Out</a> through <a href="http://triplej.net.au/">TripleJ</a>'s <a href="http://www.triplejunearthed.com/">Unearthed</a> program.
