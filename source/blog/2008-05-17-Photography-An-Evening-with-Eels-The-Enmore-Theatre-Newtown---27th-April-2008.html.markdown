<p style="text-align: center;"><small>Very few useable shots from An Evening with Eels @ The Enmore - this is definitely the best</small></p>

I was forewarned about shooting E by <a href="http://flickr.com/people/letsmakeart/">Matt Palmer</a> after bad <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/concertshots/discuss/72157604708785283/">experiences up in Brisbane</a>, however I'd say he was either on something (highly unusual for a musician of course) or was told to smarten up post event (highly unusual for a musician of big enough ego to listen to such advice). Whatever the reason, beyond needing to stay behind the first exit sign doors on the sides there didn't appear to be too many issues - unless you count #1 lighting; and #2 E wearing a fricking baseball cap. Listen, it's all cool and everything to wear one - outside during the day - but with theatrical lighting you're not going to see a face at all in the shots. If that's what you're after, at least go the Tism path of never actually showing your face!

Anyhow, it was actually quite a nice show and glad that it turned out to be enjoyable. While he's obviously got an ego, had he decided to ditch the lame attempts at jokes about fan male (love, love then a hate letter) or reviews (all about the co-musician, all about the co-musician and then a review about the Eagles and him going off at his support crew - wonder how many times they've done that - seemed all very lame and far too put on... perhaps that's what the audience wanted though) and focussed on the music more it would have been better.

All in all I had fun, though was more than disappointed by the lighting. Giving the photographers three songs is fair enough so that they don't ruin things for the crowd, but if that's the case, can the performers realise that it is in their interests to have a good lighting scheme that doesn't wait till 2/3 of the way through the <strong>set</strong> before it hits!
