Probably not the first person to be writing on this topic, but thought I would anyhow.

On the bus home from work at uni, reading the news and read <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">explosions in London underground</a> on the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au">Sydney Morning Herald</a>. Since then I've sat down for dinner, and turned on the tele to see that the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/">7:30 Report</a> has been extended for half an hour to cover the events. Instead of watching the streamed content from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">BBC</a> via the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC</a> we've turned across to the BBC World News channel itself which is covering the news in depth.

Interesting to note is how slow <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=london%20bombing&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&sa=N&tab=wn">Google's news section</a> has been in picking up the feeds coming out across the media organisations.

Stay tuned to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> for more information.

edit: Two confirmed dead and scores injured, BBC World News.

edit: BBC World airs claims that a security firm monitoring al-Qaeda and Arab correspondence believes it almost certainly is the work of the distributed terror organisation.

edit: scotland yard say atleast -6- +7+ explosions, atleast two dead (confirmed) and many injured.
