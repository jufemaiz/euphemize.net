Old news I know, but still worthy of comment, are the methods being employed by the Coalition in this election campaign. They are trying to take on education in their own way, or should I say ways. In complete isolation to Kelly's of the Coalition have decided to launch their own education policies, unbeknown to the poor bastards trying to orchestrate an electoral campaign on the coalition's behalf.

Jackie Kelly, Minister for Sport last I checked, came out with this idea:
<blockquote>any future increases in federal funding should be directed on a per capita basis to local councils, thereby bypassing state governments, which operate public schools. "These committees would direct the new money according to the agreed priority of needs of schools in the local area," she writes in her Kelly Country education update.

"In this way federal funding for state schools would not be lost in the state bureaucracy and increases would be fairly passed on."</blockquote>
This was quickly refuted by the Education Minister's, Dr Brendan Nelson spokesman:
<blockquote>Ms Kelly's plan was "not government policy and will not be".</blockquote>

Poor Dr Nelson's department must have thought that having one of Mr Howards chief terriers going out of party space to launch policy would have been enough, but the second Ms Kelly - this time the National MP De-Anne Kelly has come out firing with the concept of replacing educational funding with a voucher system [the same amount for all I assume]. Yet another step away from the concepts of the taxation system in the country, and again quickly this spot fire was hosed down by Dr Nelson's minders.

Not to be content, Ms Kay Hull came out in support of the Labor education policy in direct contradiction to her party leader John 'The greens are really communists" Anderson and their lovely overall leader Mr Howard, but went further saying that the wealthy attending the government schools [well, really all schools receiving any funding from the government should be called such] should pay for the privelage. This was again refuted by the now tired Dr Nelson's department.

You'd think that in an election campaign, especially with the whole 'security' thing blown out of proportions, that the PM would have got his troops together to ensure a united front is being presented. Really a worry this whole thing... blo0ody women ;)
