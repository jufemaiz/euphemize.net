Surfing around the web at work whilst waiting for a <a href="http://www.sas.com/">SAS</a> program to run, I came across the <a href="http://smh.com.au">Sydney Morning Herald</a> doing a gallery of past <a href="http://apple.com/au/">apple</a> computers and saw my old Apple IIc (pictured below, c/o <a href="http://smh.com.au">SMH</a>). I used this for about six or eight years, from primary school up until the start of year 9 in 1997 (I think) when we finally upgraded, but steered away from the apple's to a Compaq Pentium 75MHz. But I did return, purchasing an iBook in the middle of 2004 (mainly to help finish my thesis - a lovely little baby 12" screened one), and am currently looking at moving to either a powermac or imac - or wait till the new Intel chipped version of the powermac comes out.
