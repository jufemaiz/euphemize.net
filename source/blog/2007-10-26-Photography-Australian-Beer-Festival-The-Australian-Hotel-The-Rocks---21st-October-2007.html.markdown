After I dropped my cousin Stephen off at Sydney Airport for his flights back to Sweden I headed over to <a href="http://marsupialmusic.net/stu/">Stu</a>'s for some lunch before heading into the Rocks to meet up with some of the Chemical Engineers from USYD for the Australian Beer Festival. Since I was driving I was limited in my tasting options, however that was not the case for Stu, Phil, Sam or Paul and  they proceeded to sample the best of what was on offer.

My limited offering would be that beyond the favoured Golden Ale from <a href="http://www.jamessquire.com.au/">Malt Shovel Brewery</a> the <a href="http://www.redoak.com.au/">Red Oak</a> has some smashing options, and for the city workers has its microbrewery-pub located conveniently in on Clarence Street. Definitely going to have to get people over there for a post-work beer sometime soon.

For dinner we headed to the <a href="http://www.belgian-beer-cafe.com.au">Belgium Beer Cafe</a> for mussels for those with high blood alcohol readings and something less filling for the designated driver. Have to head back there on the Wednesday arvo/night for the male mussel deal (to compliment the free alcohol for ladies wearing red). Finally dropped everyone home and was given a tip/incentive from Phil to do so - a mixed case of Golden Ale and Amber Ale.
