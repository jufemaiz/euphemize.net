from <a href="http://smh.com.au/news/Breaking/Worm-spreads-to-sites-through-ads/2004/11/23/1100972361315.html">The Sydney Morning Herald comes news of a new bug with IE (suprise su-fucking-prise)</a>.

According to the latest information
<blockquote>"This may indicate a more wide-spread attack across Europe. One suggestion is that the advertising servers rather than the sites themselves contain the exploit, which of course means that perhaps hundreds of sites are affected," it said in an advisory.The vulnerability being exploited was discovered on October 24. The flaw lies in the IFRAME tags of Internet Explorer 6.0 and it affects all Windows platforms except those which have installed service pack 2 for Windows XP.</blockquote>
