Like WTF am I getting SPAM about christ for. I know where the church is, I'll go if I damn well please...

Now I thought that the internet was the last refuge for those of use who wish to escape religion. At uni I'm constantly told by the 'Christian Bible Study' group that I'll go to hell if I don't believe. But it's not only if I don't believe in christianity, but it has to be <em>their</em> version of christianity. Thanks but no - I'll make my decision myself.

Then I go and check my spam account, and lo-and-behold, I'm the target of further spam attacks. Now apparently we can get christian home loans. I thought that for a long time that the Jewish people in Europe ran the loans service because doing such thing was believed to be against the Holy Book. What has changed since?!?!?
