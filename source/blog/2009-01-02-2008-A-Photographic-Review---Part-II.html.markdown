<div class="caption"><small>The ever present shoe shots - this one is Johnny Marr's</small></div>

April was a big shooting month, made ever easier by my close proximity to the city - about a 15 minute walk. First up was shooting for <a href="http://withtheband.com.au/">Reverb Magazine</a> - this time it was <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/04/12/modest-mouse-and-hot-hot-heat-at-the-big-top-luna-park/">Modest Mouse with support from Hot Hot Heat @ The Big Top</a> over at Luna Park.

<div class="caption"><small>Spencer Platt - absolutely fantastic photojournalist speaking at SemiPermanent 2008</small></div>

Next up saw me attending my annual anti-engineering conference - <a href="http://www.semipermanent.com/">SemiPermanent</a>. It was unreal - one of their speakers was <a href="http://www.lightstalkers.org/spencerplatt">Spencer Platt</a> who won the 2007 <a href="http://www.worldpressphoto.org/">World Press Photo</a> with <a href="http://www.worldpressphoto.org/index.php?option=com_photogallery&amp;task=view&amp;id=899&amp;Itemid=115&amp;bandwidth=low">his photograph while covering the Isreali-Lebanon conflict of that year</a>.

The 10th saw me shooting for EnergyAustralia at the <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/05/17/photography-energyaustralia-staff-launch-of-great-southern-oceans-exhibit-taronga-zoo-mosman-10th-april-2008/">Staff Launch of the Great Southern Oceans exhibit</a> that they are sponsors of at Taronga Zoo. Not too much I can show of this, but it was definitely an interesting shoot.

My final gig for April was shooting <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/05/17/photography-an-evening-with-eels-the-enmore-theatre-newtown-27th-april-2008/">An Evening with Eels at the Enmore Theatre</a>. This was one of the toughest shoots I've done with a single lamp on the piano as the light source.

<h3><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/archives/date-taken/2008/05/">May</a></h3>

May saw me become nearly a regular at <a href="http://www.annandalehotel.com/">The Annandale Hotel</a>.

<div class="image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/2479854693/" title="Kate Miller-Heidke @ The Annandale Hotel, Annandale - 9th May, 2008 (by 'ju:femaiz)"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2348/2479854693_962b220c75.jpg" title="Kate Miller-Heidke @ The Annandale Hotel, Annandale - 9th May, 2008 (by 'ju:femaiz)" alt="Kate Miller-Heidke @ The Annandale Hotel, Annandale - 9th May, 2008 (by 'ju:femaiz)" width="333" height="500" /></a></div>
<div class="caption"><small>My new music photography crush: <strong>Kate Miller-Heidke @ The Annandale Hotel, Annandale</strong> - <em>9th May, 2008</em></small></div>

My first gig was <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/05/18/kate-miller-heidke-at-the-annandale-hotel-annandale-9th-may-2008/">Kate Miller-Heidke at The Annandale</a>. Now, while I had vaguely heard of her, I didn't know too much when I put my hand up to shoot her for <a href="http://thedwarf.com.au">The Dwarf</a>, but boy would I be glad I did. Kate is an absolute gem to shoot - cute, quirky and knows how to perform on stage (coming from her training in opera no doubt). Her backup was the band now formed around Christopher Ernst (whom I had <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/08/13/the-beautiful-girls-at-bar-on-the-hill-newcastle/">previously shot</a>) - <a href="http://theblackmarketrhythmco.com/">Black Market Rhythm Co</a>.

The next weekend I was <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/06/01/whitley-at-the-annandale-hotel-annandal/">back at The Annandale to shoot Whitley</a>. This just wasn't my night as my batteries hadn't charged properly, leaving me hobbling for power during Whitley's set. I did however come out with what might well be 2008's best shot.

June was a more subdued affair and I took an extra day off work for the long weekend to <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/06/10/roadtrip-to-orange/">visit friends Nadine and Andrew up at Orange</a>. In addition to the winery visits I also got a tour of the electrical installations at the mine where she works. This also saw the month of Lucky's <a href="http://www.mulletgod.org/photoshopactions/">Photoshop Actions</a> being released - go check them out if you don't already have them! Nadine and Andrew's Golden Retriever pup Mahler was so cute and playful, and their friends had an even younger Chocolate Labrador called Oscar.

The general geekery brought to a close the second quarter of 2008, where I also added another notch to my age-belt making me feel so much older and missing much in life in areas that cannot easily be obtained.
