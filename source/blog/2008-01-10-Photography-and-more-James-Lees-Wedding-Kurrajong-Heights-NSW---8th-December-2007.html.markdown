Another older lot of photos from a friends wedding in the Blue Mountains on the 8th of December last year. Lee looked great, and James didn't scrub up to badly either. Was a fun day spent with friends from uni before half of them headed overseas, and the rest started work.

While I wasn't the official photographer, Lee asked me to shoot the groomsmen beforehand - similar to what I did with Charles and Kate. Despite persistent comments from one of the guys (<q>Joel, you know they've got a photographer</q>) I kept shooting from spots the official photographer wasn't covering, so I hope they like them.

More after the break or in the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157603407221601/">flickr set</a>.
