Mate from <a href="http://www.graphic-forums.com">graphic forums</a> needed some help with implementation of xhtml/css on something he's been working on. Looks simple enough, so I thought I'd go for it. 25minutes later, and presto:

<a href="http://consulting.euphemize.net/digitaldoodler/">the solution</a> to <a href="http://www.lyriclemur.com/other/lyriclemur2.jpg">the problem</a>.

So, in relation to the questions:
<blockquote>

I want the lemur graphic to stay positioned in the top left, and I want all of the buttons to stay positioned in the top right. Then I want the "LyricLemur" text to be positioned in the center of all that...

How would I go about doing that? I've read about CSS, and I understand it, but I'm bad at figuring out what to use to do what...

Also, is it possible to make those buttons out of CSS, rather than using graphics for the borders, etc.?

</blockquote>

Yes it is completely possible.
