<blockquote><p><q cite="http://www.smh.com.au/letters/index.html?page=fullpage">The Qantas chairwoman, Margaret Jackson, is a shining example of the modern "Spirit of Australia". Unapologetic, self-serving, and only acts decently when forced.</q></p><p><cite><strong>Paul Clarke</strong> Kensington</cite></p></blockquote>
I could not have summed up the state of the nation any more eloquently. Thank you Paul Clarke. I only wish things would change.

Also, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/cartoons/index.html">the daily cartoon</a> at the Herald is a classic poke at the federal government's change of name for the new Industrial Relations policy (in spite of it remaining on the statute books as "Work Choices"). Apparently the policy itself isn't bad, it's just the public perception of it is horrid.

As is said in politics:
<blockquote><p><q>Reality is nothing, it's the perception of reality that is everything</q></p></blockquote>
Hence why people blindly believe that the Liberal/National coalition is far better at "economic management" than Labor despite evidence to the contrary.
