I've been at a gig by my mates band <a href="http://www.thelyricalmadmen.com">The Lyrical Madmen</a> tonight held at the Empire Hotel in Annandale (Sydney, Australia). The support act was Roger Explosion (no website afaik) and they went off - great music and great live act. Madmen's set was good and it's nice to see them back out amongst the live music scene... Pics to come... Till then, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57005739@N00/">flickr</a>:
