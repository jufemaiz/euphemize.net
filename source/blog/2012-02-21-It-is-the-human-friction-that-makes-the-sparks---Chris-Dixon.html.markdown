Universities, generally, silo groups away from one another - reducing precisely these types of sparks.

I remember attending an interactive art exhibition at the University of Technology, Sydney as a guest of IBM Australia, and found myself scratching my head. Why was it that all these artistic folk with great ideas (from talking to them) were getting bogged down learning how to programme instead of teaming up with the university's computer science & engineering groups. The silo that was created by sticking only with like people ended up implementing ideas in the space which were stale, low quality and not-innovative at all. The most amazing exhibit was one that had already been commercialised for public spaces - with the combined talent of artists' vision and engineers' implementation.

While it is understandable that we stick like with like - it's not always the best approach.
