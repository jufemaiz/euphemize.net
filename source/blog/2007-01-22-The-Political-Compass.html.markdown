I last took <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/">The Political Compass</a> "<a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/questionnaire">test</a>" a few years back when I came across it, though when I cannot remember. IT is designed to test you in more than a single dimension - it looks at both economic spheres and social spheres.
<h3>Economic Sphere</h3>
This tends to be the traditional separation of left versus right that have been the hallmark of politics for much of modern life. This is the old <a title="Grand Old Party" href="http://www.rnc.org/">Republican</a> versus <a href="http://www.democrats.org/">Democracts</a>, <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/">Tories</a> versus <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/">Labour</a>, <a href="http://www.liberal.org.au/">Liberal</a> (said with much irony) versus <a href="http://www.alp.org.au/">Labor</a>. I know personally where I sit on this one, as do most of my friends. I believe that it comes from having a strong social conscience, believing in what most religions golden rule seems to be (despite being an aethiest):
<blockquote>...do unto others as you would do unto you...</blockquote>
This is not to say that it is the "right" or the "only" way one should live their life, but it is the way that I believe one should try to live.
<h3>Social Sphere</h3>
This tends to describe how one would like the state to operate - from fascism (authoritarian) through to anarchy (libertarian). Again, where I sit is, I believe, a reflection of my thoughts on freedom, on certain rights that should be inherent to everyone. Liberty, it's a strong word and one that the US founding fathers had a lot of time for. Without it in freedom is but a word.
<h3>My Map</h3>

<blockquote>Economic Left/Right: -4.00
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -6.05</blockquote>

So, I've shared mine. Where do you sit?
