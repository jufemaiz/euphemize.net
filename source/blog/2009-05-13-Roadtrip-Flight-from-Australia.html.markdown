About 7 weeks back now I jumped on a plane, destination Stockholm in Sweden. It was the first leg of my second international trip, and longest to date.

The flight across to Stockholm had some interesting moments. We were running late before taking off from Bangkok and as a result we were given double delay as we missed our alloted slot for flighttime over India. Flying over India, however, I was looking out the window when I saw this interesting snake of lights. I checked the communal television on the Finnair flight to see that we were at that point in time over the Indian/Pakistani border and those lights were illuminating the border.

Running late from Bangkok, I arrived in Helsinki to find I had about 30 minutes until my next plane took off. Rushed through security by a kind airport security lady I then had to sprint from one side of the airport (international arrivals) to the other (local European flights) via immigration (the gent behind the desk seemed to take little interest in me as he went through the usual Q+A for a visitor to Europe - name, nationality, identification number, reason for trip, mother's birthplace etc). I arrived with about a minute before the bus took off from the gate to an outlying commuter plane - thankful that I'd made it.
