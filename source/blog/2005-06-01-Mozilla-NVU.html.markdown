There's a new piece of competition that is sure to stir the recent bonding of <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> and <a href="http://www.macromedia.com">macromedia</a>:

<a href="http://www.nvu.com/">NVU</a>!!!

Based on the gecko engine, the new web authoring tool is still in its infancy (at pre-release stage) but it looks the goods already. Being open source has some options for those looking for a dreamweaver type solution <strong>without</strong> the cost.

Also, the great <a href="http://johnhaller.com/">John Haller</a> has been working on a portable version of the software, in the same vein as his <a href="http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_firefox/">Portable Firefox</a>, <a href="http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_thunderbird/">Portable Thunderbird (for Mail)</a>, <a href="http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_sunbird/">Portable Sunbird (for a Calender)</a> and <strong>even</strong> <a href="http://johnhaller.com/jh/useful_stuff/portable_openoffice/">Portable OpenOffice</a>.

Full review on this software will be up shortly, but needless to say, I've been using portable firefox at university to save me from that godam aweful IE6 (though I eagerly await IE7)...
