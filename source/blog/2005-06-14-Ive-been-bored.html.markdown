...it's <abbr title="Study Vacation">stuvac</abbr> and what else is there to do but proactively procrastinate on the intarweb.

Came across two brilliant sites today well worth checking out:

<a href="http://www.reelfx.com/"><img alt="Reel FX" src="http://euphemize.net/img/wordpress/reel-fx.jpg" /></a>

<a href="http://www.reelfx.com/">Reel FX</a> - a group of over a hundred artists of all sorts mainly targeting the 3d effects market - with some great stuff to keep you entertained for about an hour.

<a href="http://amfilms.hash.com/search/entry.php?entry=1065"><img alt="The Duel" src="http://euphemize.net/img/wordpress/the-duel.jpg" /></a>

<a href="http://amfilms.hash.com/search/entry.php?entry=1065">The Duel</a> meanwhile is a short flick showing some rather slick animation... Check it out too...

Later.
