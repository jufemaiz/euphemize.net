To start the year off I headed into the city after my first day back at work (and going back home to get changed and grab my camera gear) was Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. Thankfully my name was on the door list this time (unlike last time I shot there the month before) and there wasn't a problem getting in. What the problem <strong>was</strong> was that there was no photographers pit - the first time I'd seen such a thing at the Metro which is usually pretty good with this sort of thing. The crowd was one of the least accommodating of the two photographers there that night (myself and another girl shooting for a magazine). Despite only having three songs I managed to get a few decent shots - but was no where near where I wanted to be. To make up for it the set was a pretty decent one, so I returned home feeling ok about the night in the end. Support was from the <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=151495045">Black Ryder</a>
