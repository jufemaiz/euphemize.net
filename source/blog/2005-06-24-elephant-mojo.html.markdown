Met up with the <a href="http://elephantmojo.com/">crazy fellars</a> from this band on my way into uni today. Down from Brisbane to perform a couple of gigs (including one on <a href="http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/gigguide/show/4567/">saturday night at the marque in sydney</a> along with the guys from <a href="http://www.nationalpornographic.com.au">national pornographic</a> and <a href="http://www.yetanotherband.com">transport</a>).

Some great down to earth guys who reckon that:
<ul>
	<li>Sydney's public transport is a killer compared with brisvegas;</li>
	<li>Avalon (despite being slightly inbred ;)) is a top location to live; and</li>
	<li>Sydney's music scene is (somehow) better than brissies.</li>
</ul>
So if you've got time check them out...
