No this isn't some crass attempt by someone at paying out mcdonald's with their <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> account but the user name of one Brian of California in the states. With an impressive collection of recent shots, and an even larger back catalogue of over 20 years shooting his work is amongst the most impressive <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/surf/">surf photography</a> on the flickr site. He's also been a regular on the <a href="http://flickr.com/explore/">favourites page</a> a total of <a href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/flickr/scout.php?username=mcshots&sort=date&year=0">49 times and counting</a>.

Overall a great photographer and great guy who's always willing to give some feedback (like <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/65486361/">here</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/68602314/">here</a>) so <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mcshots/">check him out @ flickr</a>.
