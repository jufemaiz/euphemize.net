Browsing the sydney morning heralds <a href="http://smh.com.au/snapshots/index.html" title="SMH World Snapshots">World Snapshots</a> I came upon the following two rather disturbing images:

<img src="http://smh.com.au/ffximage/2004/10/18/19snap_monk_gallery__421x550.jpg" alt="hanging monk" />

WTF are these guys thinking?!?!?!?
