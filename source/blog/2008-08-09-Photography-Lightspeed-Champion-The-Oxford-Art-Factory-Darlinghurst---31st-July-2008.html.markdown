<div style="text-align: center"><small>The man who is Lightspeed Champion! (Star Wars geek too ;))</small></div>
I had the pleasure to shoot a great gig at the <a href="http://oxfordartfactory.com/">Oxford Art Factory</a> in the lead up to <a href="http://splendourinthegrass.com">Splendour in the Grass</a> with <a href="http://lightspeedchampion.com">Lighstpeed Champion</a> and shooting for a new outfit - <a href="http://thesydneysocial.com/">The Sydney Social</a>. The beauty of this gig - I got a plus one and was able to take the visiting <a href="http://marsupialmusic.net/nick/">Wombat</a> along to experience a Sydney gig once more after his long working-holiday-meet-the-love-of-his-life time in New York.

I'd have to say this gig was awesome - and the Oxford Art Factory seems to have improved its sound from previous gigs. Their lighting was better too - no small task when they use LEDs for stage lighting (strange I know, but true).

Overall a great night. Check out the shots below the break or at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157606492313110/">the full set on flickr</a>.
