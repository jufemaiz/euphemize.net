While I haven't been able to personally look at the beta release of Microsoft's IE7, I have been reading the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/27/444004.aspx">responses from those who have</a>. Sad that it is, I can easily put them into two camps:
<ul>
	<li>GUI Users</li>
	<li>Web Developers</li>
</ul>
The GUI Users gush and awe over how pretty the new IE7 is. Web developers on the other hand are extremely cynical of Microsoft's promises to get CSS and other Standards based support up and running. Basically from this it appears that too much time prior to the release was put into developing the pretty GUI rather than in the core rendering engine... Sounds about right for the poor engineers involved...
