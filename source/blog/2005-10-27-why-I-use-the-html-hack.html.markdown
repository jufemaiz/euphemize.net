the guys over at <a href="http://positioneverything.net">positioneverything.net</a> have just released an <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/ie7-dehacker.html">article</a> on how to deal with IE7 and all those little hacks you've had to put in for MS's secondrate and five year old browser...

Which is why I've always used the
<pre>* html</pre>
hack ladies and gentlemen. Easy, clean and it works. Best of all, no problems in the changeover to IE7.

That is all.
