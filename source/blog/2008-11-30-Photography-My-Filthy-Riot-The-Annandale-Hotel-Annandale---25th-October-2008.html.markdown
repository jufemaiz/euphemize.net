Ben Ven Grootel, a mate of mine from <a href="http://www.theroot42.org/">The Root 42</a>, headed over to the east coast on tour with his band <a href="http://myspace.com/streetlightonline">Streetlight</a> from Perth and asked me to grab some shots for them. <a href="http://annandalehotel.com.au/">The Annandale Hotel</a> has also increased their rig and pulled out all stops on the main stage today.

The Annandale Hotel has recently invested in some new lighting kit - specifically a rig of 8 LED lights. Now, normally I'd not be terribly impressed, but in this case I give full thumbs up. They're being used <em>specifically as fill lighting with smoke</em> not as primary lights and they've hence been able to retire a few of the old PAR56s to their primary role - lighting people and objects instead of filling smoke with light.

Anyhow, for those fellow photographers interested, here's an example of where The Annandale Hotel is headed with their lighting rig (note: the front-of-house lighting bar was not on for this shot and is used to compliment the back lighting with some nice white light on the face (although half the bar is gel'd yellow)

More shots after the break or <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/2989375042/">the full set at flickr</a>.
