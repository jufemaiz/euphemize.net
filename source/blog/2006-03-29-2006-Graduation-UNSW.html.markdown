Yesterday I was lucky enough to take the day off to go to my graduation for my <a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/2006/8501.html">Masters program</a> - MEngSc in Electrical Power. Was a great day to meet up with some friends of mine (mainly <a href="http://co-op.web.unsw.edu.au/">co-op scholars</a> who had their study time increased by one year and took fourth and each summer off to work at one of the sponsor companies). Took my camera and had to leave it with dad to take some of the photos - he's useless with a camera, but anyhow...
