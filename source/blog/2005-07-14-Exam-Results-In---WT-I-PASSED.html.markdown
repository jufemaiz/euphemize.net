Sitting at work (uni) waiting for my mac to update both OSX and iTunes (I think it was iTunes atleast) I got a message from one of the guys in my course. "Credits" was all it said. Turned over to mail - "You have mail". Shit, I thought, I really don't want to take a supplementary. Opened it up and got the following pleasant suprise:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2005/ELEC9213.html">ELEC9213 Electrical Energy Systems</a> 78 DN<a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2005/ELEC9214.html" /></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2005/ELEC9214.html">ELEC9214 Power Systems Equipment</a> 84 DN<a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2005/ELEC9214.html" /></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2005/ELEC9214.html">ELEC9240 Power Electronics</a> 82 DN<a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2005/SOLA9003.html" /></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2005/SOLA9003.html">SOLA9003 High Efficiency Silicon Solar Cells</a> 60 PS</li>
</ul>
Giving me an overall WAM of 76.0 (DN) for my first half of my Masters program. It's a massive relief...

Anyhow, on with the show. We've got the annual farm trip away still to come these holidays, and I can't think of a better way to cap of the first half of 2005 than away with best mates, beers, dead animal (and the occasional vegetable) and bonfires.
