<p style="text-align: center;"><small>My Daily Stats from flickr.com</small></p>

As a flickr addict I am known to check my stats page daily, finding new links in to my images (such as from <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/dig/stories/s2300275.htm">ABC's DIG Radio site</a>) and discovering what he most interesting shots are according to people out there that are using flickr to find them (for the record the list is: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/157136034/">macbooks</a> (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/157135815/">plus</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/157135432/">four</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/157135374/">more</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/157135972/">photos</a>), a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/188722613/">hairy chest</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/2268177377/">Kanye West</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/714527642/">what's in your pocket</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/427345976/">the surf at Bar Beach</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/535864452/">the beached ship Pasha Bulker at Nobby's Beach</a>). Today I came across something a little odd, it was a link in from <a href="http://threedworld.com.au/">3DWorld</a>, a street magazine in Australia devoted more to the dance music scene. The links were to some of my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157607154455902/">Shapeshifter</a> shots from last Friday's gig at The Metro in Sydney (blogpost to come - been a bit slow). I clicked through and found that they were actually coming from a <a href="http://threedworld.com.au/music/profiles/Shapeshifter/?id=697&page=photos">musician profile page for Shapeshifter</a>. What I found on the page shocked me a little bit.

<p style="text-align: center;"><small>3DWorld's respect for Intellectual Property : nil</small></p>

The photos being used by this commercial operation were none other than my own, ripped from a flickr feed provided by a request using flickr's API, completely disregarding the application of Copyright on all photos taken with All Rights Reserved. The small ferreting I did around on the site confirmed my suspicions, with an ASP (or ASP.NET) script being run on the server to obtain the photos an output as a javascript file for embedding in the website ( the offending file is available at http://threedworld.com.au/includes/RelatedFlickr-javascript.asp?tag=insert_tag_name_here_for_whatever_you_might_want ).

<h3>The Flickr API</h3>
The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a> has strict <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/tos/">Terms of Service</a> by which users shall ensure that they operate, this is particularly true for commercial operations.

In addition to the repetitive stipulation that the works hosted on flickr remain the property of those who submit, section 1(a)(ii) states clearly:

<blockquote><strong>1. Licensed Uses and Restrictions:</strong> <em>a. You shall:</em> Comply with any requirements or restrictions imposed on usage of the photos by their respective owners. Remember, Flickr doesn't own the images - Flickr users do. Although the Flickr APIs can be used to provide you with access to Flickr user photos, neither Flickr's provision of the Flickr APIs to you nor your use of the Flickr APIs override the photo owners' requirements and restrictions, which may include "all rights reserved" notices (attached to each photo by default when uploaded to Flickr), Creative Commons licenses or other terms and conditions that may be agreed upon between you and the owners. In ALL cases, you are solely responsible for making use of Flickr photos in compliance with the photo owners' requirements or restrictions. If you use Flickr photos for a commercial purpose, the photos must be marked with a Creative Commons license that allows for such use, unless otherwise agreed upon between you and the owner. You can read more about this here: <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">www.creativecommons.org</a> or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons">www.flickr.com/creativecommons</a>.</blockquote>

As a result 3DWorld, and by extension their owners at <a href="http://destra.com/">Destra Corporation</a> are in clear breach of their requirements under the API.

<h3>Not the First Time</h3>
Unfortunately this is not the first time that companies have been caught out using flickr photos via the API (or via other means) illegally. The most recent high profile case being Heineken using unauthorised photos via the API to promote the Oxygen concert in the United Kingdom. Fellow Australian music photographer <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/blackshadowphotos/">Richard Sharman</a> discovered this accidentally and led the charge that got quite wide coverage in photography circles (such as a <a href="http://aphotoeditor.com/2008/08/11/heineken-discovers-flickr-isnt-full-of-free-photography/">A Photo Editory</a>).

Since the API is easy to implement I am sure that more companies will do so. Unfortunately until they wake up to the fact that there are legal penalties and financial obligations that follow ripping photographers work off without due compensation this will continue. I've not been hyper critical of the flickr API, however, perhaps its time that photographers are allowed to limit API based access to their sites based on website URI.

<h3>Course of Action</h3>
If you've found some of your shots (it seems to be the "latest eight shots" as determined by flickr) then please comment below and I'll be in touch. I was in touch with a lawyer at close of business today, so we'll see what tomorrow brings.

The lesson out of all of this is to be vigilant. Much like the <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">price of freedom being eternal vigilance</a>, the price of ensuring your work is not appropriated by such commercial enterprises (let alone the non-commercial ones) without the required licensing being in place is to be ever vigilant of the shots your publish and the locations that they are published at.
