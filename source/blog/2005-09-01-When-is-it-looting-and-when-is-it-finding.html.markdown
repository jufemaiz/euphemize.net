Apparently yahoo! knows...

It's <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/photo/050830/480/ladm10208301530">looting if the person doing it is black</a>, but it's <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/photo/050830/photos_ts_afp/050830071810_shxwaoma_photo1"><em>finding</em> if the person is white</a>.

gota love it...
