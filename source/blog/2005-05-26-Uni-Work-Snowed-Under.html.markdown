At the moment I have work piling up around me. While I've nocked down two of three seminar talks I've had to give for my courses, I still have a few reports to write up, as shown by the following 'to-do' list:

* ELEC9213 Report - Renewable Energy: Obstacles to Implementation in a National Energy Market
* ELEC9213 Assignment 3
* ELEC9214 Seminar - Distributed Temperature Sensing using Raman anti-Stokes based Optical Time Domain Reflectometry
* ELEC9214 Report on the same
* ELEC9240 Postgraduate Assignment - Three Phase Sinewave Pulse Modulated Inverter
* and finally, there *may* be yet another ELEC9240 Assignment (#3 for the course, excluding the postgraduate one)
