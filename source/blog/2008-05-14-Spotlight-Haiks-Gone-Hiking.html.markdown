So, one of my mates from the creative collective that is <a href="http://theroot42.org">The Root 42</a> is heading off with <a href="http://adrienneineurope2008.blogspot.com/">Adri</a> his girl for a round trip - taking in (and I am sure catching up with, aka couch surfing at, plenty of fellow TR42ers) the world. To help him record the journey, especially while away from the opportunity to post copious amounts of <a href="http://www.digitalomo.com/">Digitalomo</a> shots, he made himself a <a href="http://haikavanian.com/forty-two-hardcover-sketchbook/">lovely little book</a> - something I'm hoping to do... one day... someday... soon?

Anyhow, <a href="http://haikavanian.com/42days/">follow him + his lass</a> as they traips around the European continent.
