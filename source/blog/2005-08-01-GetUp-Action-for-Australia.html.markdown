As we all (by we I mean Australians who take atleast a passing interest in the political landscape of the nation they inhabit) now are aware, Little Johnny Howard has scared enough of the populace to gain a majority in not only the lower house of Federal Parliament (as required by a party or coalition to form a real government in this fine nation of ours) but also in the upper house, the Senate, traditionally a place where the bastards (be they of Liberal or Labor ilk, or even more unlikely the till now balls-less National Party) honest by the 'rest of them'. This a rather scary proposition - even more so now that the Nationals have realised that they, as the smaller party of the Coalition, weild the <strong>real</strong> power (do a google search on Queensland Nationals or Barnaby Joyce).

Now the problem is that there's noone really to keep the bastards honest (especially after a certain Democrat leader sold out to make her name in history and at the same time bring down the party she led), and the gap appears to be being met by an unlikely alliance including Directors of the group ex-Liberal Party leader John Hewson and the Australian Workers Union national secretary Bill Shorten amongst others (<a href="http://smh.com.au/news/national/lobbyist-get-up-gears-up-for-senate/2005/07/31/1122748524711.html">smh story</a>).

I really do suggest any Aussie support a group with such a wide political range of backing - atleast till the next election...
