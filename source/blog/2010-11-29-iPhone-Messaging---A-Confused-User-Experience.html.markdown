I have now been using an iPhone for over three years, becoming a convert after a long standing allegiance with the world of Nokia (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_5110">5110</a>, an 8265, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6110">6610</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6230">6230</a> over the course of seven years). As I've used the device I've come to note that I consider it a far more "integrated communications" device - blurring the lines between email and sms in particular - rather than compartmentalising each communications path by their different streams.

The iPhone itself does represent somewhat of a step away from the increasingly complex user interfaces that have plagued the upgrading of the mobile device over the past decade. My Aunt found learning to use her phone to be quite difficult, however when I gave her my 2G iPhone to play with during the first month I had it she found it more intuitive than anything she'd used before. That's not to say that the iPhone is a simple device - quite the contrary, it is has far more similarities with a low-power mobile computer than it does with the early and low end mobile phones. What Apple have done, however, is keep the interface simple.

Many people have commented on the iOS (operating system that the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad run on) is exceptionally easy to use. There are videos of one and two year old playing with devices and learning quickly how to unlock the device - even if they do not realise what they're doing. A result of this is quite quickly your muscle memory learns the commands needed to achieve the results that you are after - unlocking, answering a call, choosing to view messages, to change music tracks and so on.

In spite of this, and particularly given Apple's commitment to the design of user experience, there is a failing in the design of their messaging system. Put simply: the process of creating and sending an SMS versus an email use near exact opposite methods.
<h3>Create and Send an Email</h3>
To create and send an email, you need to do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Select email</li>
	<li>Tap the "Create email" button</li>
	<li>Fill in details</li>
	<li>Tap the "Send" button</li>
</ol>
The following images are screen captures from an iPhone 3GS running iOS4.

At top is the listing of emails, with the "new email" button bottom right, the "edit" button top right and the "back" button top left.

On the bottom is the new email input screen, with "cancel" button top left and "send" button top right.
<h3>Send an SMS</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Select SMS</li>
	<li>Tap the "Create email" button</li>
	<li>Fill in details</li>
	<li>Tap the "Send" button</li>
</ol>

<h3>Differences are Key</h3>
As you use the device more, you get faster as you learn to memory the command structures. You're also more likely to start to ignore the differences between email and SMS, however this often leads to problems.
<h4>Create new Message</h4>
<a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0588.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-623" title="Email » List of Email" src="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0588.png" alt="Email » List of Email" width="320" height="480" /></a>
<a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0586.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-622" title="SMS » List of SMS" src="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0586.png" alt="SMS » List of SMS" width="320" height="480" /></a>

Shown above are the screens from which to start a new message. For email this is bottom left, for SMS this is top right (also the location for "edit" to allow easy removal enmass of messages). Whilst annoying, this is not terribly critical, however it would appear to be an oversight in user experience where similar use cases (with the exception of the technology selected) require different trigger locations for the "create new message" comand.
<h4>Sending or Cancelling</h4>
<a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0589.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" title="Email » New Email" src="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0589.png" alt="Email » New Email" width="320" height="480" /></a>
<a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_05871.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-621" title="SMS » New Message" src="http://euphemize.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_05871.png" alt="SMS » New Message" width="320" height="480" /></a>

The "new message" screens, however, have cause for a much more disastrous consequence as a result of button locations. With the SMS screen the location of the "Cancel" button is in the same place as the "Send" button of the email screen. Far too often do I find myself hitting cancel on an SMS, only to find that I need to go back and retype it. The cancel button is destructive in the SMS context - however cancelling an email prompts a user to decide whether to save it as a draft or let the email-in-works be destroyed).
<h3>A more consistent approach?</h3>
Is there reasoning for SMS difference? I believe the justification is that the message "stream" of past messages can be visible above the message being written with SMS (unlike email) and hence the need to bind the "Send" button to the message itself, rather than the stream or conversation.

However, given that the blurring of the lines of the communications path is more than underway, I would like to see Apple provide some form of rescue function - given the selection of location to trigger these polar-opposite functions in messaging (destruction versus sending). While a "Do you *really* want to cancel this SMS?" type message would be exceedingly annoying, migrating the SMS message screens to that seen with email (and subsequently adopted by all applications I've used to date to provide similar messaging capabilities) would be an obvious answer since it is not possible to be composing multiple SMSs in a single message stream context at the same time (reducing the need to bind the "send" button to the message itself).
