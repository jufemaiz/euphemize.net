Well, I've been saving up for this for ages, and have finally been able to afford it thanks to a <a href="http://euphemize.net/archives/20050526/the-music-lounge/">few</a> <a href="http://euphemize.net/archives/20041015/website-goes-live-waterhog-water-storage/">projects</a> <a href="http://euphemize.net/archives/20050526/steven-fosters-travel-blog/ ">I've</a> <a href="http://euphemize.net/archives/20050526/sally-dominguez/">been working on</a>.

So it's in my hands as I sit at a computer <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au">at uni</a> and I can't wait to get home to charge it up and get out and shoot. I didn't get the lense at this stage, but I got these:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.canon.com.au/products/cameras/digital_slr/eos20d.html">Canon EOS 20D</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://img.digitalshop.ru/img/big/tovar/Canon_Battery_GripBG-E2.jpg">Canon EOS 20D Battery Grip</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sandisk.com/retail/cf.asp">Sandisk Ultra II 1Gig memory card</a></li>
</ul>
So expect some shots from mates surf session tomorrow to arrive online...
