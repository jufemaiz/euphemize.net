I picked up a set of <a href="http://www.cableyoyo.com/coolfeethome.html">cool feet by bluelounge</a> from the <a href="http://www.nextbyte.com.au/">NextByte</a> Apple shop at Broadway in Sydney about a month back to test for <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2006/06/15/upgrading-the-baby/">my baby macbook</a> when I wasn't at home (and a temporary solution while I awaited the arrival of an Apple keyboard and <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/elevator/">the elevator</a> from <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/">Griffin</a>). Prior to getting these little things I was using four minidiscs to prop up the rear of the macbook to increase cooling. This worked though was not exactly optimal so when I saw the little cool feet I grabbed them. At around $AU20 they're an absolute bargain.

The cool feet package contains the little red bag to hold the feet in when on the move, two large feet, two small feet and four adhesive backed discs of the relevant sizes to match the feet. The discs are attached to the laptop's base to ensure that there is a firm location for the suction cups of the feet to stick to. The feet themselves are made out of a plasticy material that does not slip easily when on most surfaces, making it a sturdy platform to work from. The big problem with the newer laptops is that there is so much heat needed to be dissipated  compared to their slower counterparts. While there are improvements being made, there is still a large correlation between speed and heat. Allowing air flow through underneath the laptop by separating the base from the table (normally great heat insulators), or even legs (ouch that's hot!), aids the natural cooling of the laptop and lowers the strain being placed on the machine.

Ergonomics were also an issue with my macbook when on the minidisc stacks. While this method allowed the rear of the macbook to rise and get some air flow, the method was doing nothing for reducing the strain on the wrists. By giving the whole laptop height, and a little bit of a slant, the keyboard is brought to the natural position found in most desktop computer keyboards, allowing for longer stints at the computer.

I've really not yet found a problem with these little things. The only thing you need to remember is not to stick the feet together when putting them back in their pouch as the plastic can warp a little and take some time to return to normal once you get them out. Additionally, I rarely used them for with the macbook on my lap - these are mainly used for assistance on table tops.  They're not life changing - but they <strong>do</strong> make keeping your laptop cooler a lot easier. For their price they're a great deal for a real solution, and a little cheaper than what I paid for my magic minidisc stack.
