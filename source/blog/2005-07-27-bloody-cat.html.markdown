Our cat, meg, escaped last night... Being an indoors only cat, I doubt she's got much street sense, and escaping at night I don't think she'll be able to work out how the hell to get home...

Here's hoping she does...

<strong>Edit</strong>: 36hrs later she arrived back home, alot weaker than when she left... I think she'll sleep for a couple of solid days.
