Walking around the inner-city and inner west this evening on my way home from an evening out with friends and beyond in Surry Hills I began thinking to myself about the change that parents must undergo as they allow their children to be fully free.

My mother used to not be able to sleep till I was home, and I'm sure my two siblings can attest to this fact.
