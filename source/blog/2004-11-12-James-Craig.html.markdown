The <a href="http://http://www.australianheritagefleet.com.au/JCraig/JCraig.html">James Craig</a> is part of the <a href="http://http://www.australianheritagefleet.com.au/Index/">Australian Heritage Fleet</a>, and kept at Darling Harbour in Sydney.

My Uncle (who is a member of the crew) and Aunty gave me a free couple of tickets for the day sail for my birthday this year, so I took my camera along for the ride.
