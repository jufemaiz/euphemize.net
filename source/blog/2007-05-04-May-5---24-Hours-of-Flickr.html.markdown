Well, <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> is undertaking a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/24flickr/">global photography event</a>. Tomorrow they're asking people to document their lives - from the fantastic to the mundane. It will be interesting to see what different people come up with to show the day off
<blockquote cite="http://www.flickr.com/groups/24flickr/">What happens around the world in one day? In a word â€“ life. Here on Flickr, our members are sharing the world that they see: snapping daily moments, recording history, telling stories, capturing beauty.</blockquote>
To anyone with an account all I can say is "do it". I'll be testing my neck with my camera, but grab whatever camera you have and take a photo of everything for the day. Should be an interesting experiment to say the least. Definitely going to grab one of the books that comes out of this (my library is growing steadily, particularly after an amazon raid and semipermanent this year) - the money raised is going to <a href="http://www.msf.org/">MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res</a> (well, $US1 from every book up to $US10k).

To those wanting a schooner rant, it'll be up hopefully by end of trade today.
