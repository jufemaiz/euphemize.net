...comes true... (well, one of them atleast)...

I had it set in my mind for some odd reason that my exam was this afternoon (I'd be in there now)... I live about an 40minutes away from uni by car or 1.5hrs by bus so I always leave really early, checked the location of exam before leaving at around 9 this morning and had a heart attack - exam started at 9. FUCK!

So - begged dad to drive me (ended up taking an hour, due to an accident in the eastern distributor in sydney that is the quickest way to get from the north side of the harbour bridge to uni). Arrived halfway through exam (but thankfully was offered an additional hour, of which i used half of it), but arrived with shaking hands. Never fucked up so hardcore in my life.

On the upside the exam wasn't too bad (so finished in 2/3 the time allocated had I got there on time). Next time I think I'll tattoo the times into my body somehow...

Moral of the story:
<blockquote>Check, check and check 50 billion times again the time that your exam is on.</blockquote>
