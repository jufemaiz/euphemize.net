For once I don't have too many photos to show. I headed out to Orange to catch up with a couple of friends I hadn't seen in nearly two years (I'd been bad in keeping up with people for a long time). I headed out early on Saturday morning, with the full knowledge that I had a long weekend rather than the short two day recovery period. I arrived in around about 3 hours 45 minutes excluding stops, which wasn't too bad considering the grey hair brigade that I hit at on the way into Lithgow that didn't realise, or chose to ignore, that when you're towing a trailer and struggling to hit 50km/h on the uphill (yet cruise happily along at the speed limit on the downhills) it's probably a good idea to pull over every so often and let the thirty to fifty cars you've got tailing you pass.

While up there I discovered the following interesting facts about Orange:
<ul>
	<li>There's a massive big hole in the ground - and when I mean massive I mean it! Over half vertical a km of ore has been pulled out!</li>
	<li>Water's an issue - they've not had the floods... yet...</li>
	<li>Houses vary substantially in prices! And it's far more expensive than I would have thought in town!</li>
	<li>If anyone wants to know of a business opportunity - good quality coffee in Orange would be a start! (best coffee was that I had at my friends place!)</li>
	<li>Puppies are invariably cute - and rather photogenic (when not attempting to eat the camera</li>
	<li>Good friends always will be!</li>
</ul>

I only ended up taking a few shots this trip - was definitely more about spending some time with old friends. Those I did I was able to play around with <a href="http://www.mulletgod.org/">Lucky</a>'s new <a href="http://www.mulletgod.org/photoshopactions/">Photoshop Action set</a>.
