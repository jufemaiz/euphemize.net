Most people know that I have a soft spot for a site called <a href="http://aquabumps.com">aquabumps</a>. I <a href="http://euphemize.net/wordpress/tag/aquabumps/">rave about it quite often"</a> (until people either visit the site or tell me to shut up). Eugene Tan, the man behind it, has been a source of inspiration to me for some time. His photography is absolutely stunning. To make things better, he's just opened up a gallery space in Bondi (<a href="http://www.aquabumps.com/photos/gallerylaunch/">photos of the launch</a>) and it looks absolutely awesome. I can't wait to go down and check it out.
