<p style="text-align: center;"><small>The money shot: Mr Xavier Rudd commanding the stage at the Enmore Theatre</small></p>

<a href="http://www.xavierrudd.com/">Xavier Rudd</a> is touring around Australia at the moment as part of his worldwide White Moth tour, bring Canandian <a href="http://www.jeremyfishermusic.com/">Jeremy Fisher</a> with him as support.

The gig definitely didn't disappoint. Jeremy Fisher came on at about 8pm for a half hour set, playing a bunch of blues inspired love ballads. He had some great ideas for the gents about wooing the ladies - aim low, that way you can only get better with age, don't be that guy who &quot;isn't who the girl married&quot; due to him getting worse rather than better. Kept the crowd amused.

Though rostered for a 9pm start, Xavier kept everyone waiting his arrival for a bit - coming on about 15 minutes late. Three songs was all I got as the clamp down continued on shooting the bigger names in Australian music, but that gave me more than enough time. It would be nice if they allowed us to shoot from the light + sound booth, or upstairs, for a little bit after, but oh well...

Left here a little early to head over to Will &amp; Toby's at Taylor's Square for the British outfit Belleruche...
