The Australian party <em>Family First</em> has sold out on its constituents by <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/student-union-fees-bill-is-passed/2005/12/09/1134086800068.html">voting for the VSU legislation in its entirety</a>. I'll have a longer rant on this shortly but two things are clear:
<ol>
	<li>Family First doesn't believe that childcare facilities, free legal advice, medical assistance etc is needed by families with parents or children who are students</li>
	<li>The other Queensland National Senators have sold out their constituents (as have all small l Liberals and other National senators).</li>
</ol>
