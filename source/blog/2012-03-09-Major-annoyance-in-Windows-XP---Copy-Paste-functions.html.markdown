I'm currently attempting to shift large files around on a Windows XP machine (the joys of enterprise) and have run into a major annoyance that reduces productivity dramatically.

When you have files in your clipboard, and have pasted them, and then you are awaiting the files to be created in the destination, you <strong>cannot</strong> copy any other items or the paste function will cease.

If you happen to be transferring close to a gigabyte, well, you should go and find something else to do for a while.
