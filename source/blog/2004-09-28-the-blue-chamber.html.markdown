following on from the crimson room and the viridian room is the blue chamber...

go play <a href="http://www.fasco-csc.com/works/bluechamber/index_e.php">here eh</a>...

I'll write up some tips later on but it looks like it'll be easier than the viridian room...

tips:
<ol>
<li>the painting moves when you click it in a certain order as though you were attempting to pull it off</li>
<li>remember how to send sms's to use the phone ;)</li>
<li>the tube is like one of those money tubes used at supermarkets</li>
</ol>
