They've launched a website to keep in touch with the rest of us poor buggers still in the land of oz.

It was also good to hear that they were safe after landing in the UK on the morning of the <a href="http://euphemize.net/archives/20050707/london-explosions/">London Bombings</a>. So have fun guys and stay safe...
