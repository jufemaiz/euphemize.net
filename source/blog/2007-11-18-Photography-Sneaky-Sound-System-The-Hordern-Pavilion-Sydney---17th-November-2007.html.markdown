<p style="text-align: center"><small>Required clothing for Sneaky Sound Systems: flouro clothing + a plethora of glo-sticks!</small></p>
I got a call on Thursday to cover either <a href="http://katalystmusic.com.au/">Katalyst</a> or <a href="http://sneakysoundsystem.com/">Sneaky Sound System</a> from Angus at <a href="http://inthemix.com.au/">InTheMix</a>. With the opportunity to shoot at the Hordern Pavilion again I jumped at the chance of shooting Sneaky Sounds (the last time having shot <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/08/07/kaiser-chiefs-at-the-hordern-pavilion/">Kaiser Chiefs</a>).

After a small mix up with passes at the start, namely there wasn't a photographers pass for me waiting at the guest list booth, a call to Sneaky Sound System's Amber Zada cleared things up quickly and I was issued with a Working Pass for the gig, enabling me to shoot all the way up till my three songs were completed. With support from the Australian band <a href="http://vanshe.com">Van She</a> and <a href="http://robyn.com/">Robyn</a> from the United Kingdom. In addition there were a couple of <acronym title="disc jockeys">DJ</acronym>s spinning records, <acronym title="compact discs">cd</acronym> and mp3s to keep the crowd happy in between acts.

I've got to say that I've never seen as much flouro and glo-sticks in the one location in a long time. Given it was an all ages event I was surprised that the Hordern didn't have an area sectioned off for alcohol to be served where the under-18s weren't allowed. Licensing laws being what they are. Anyhow, the night was enjoyable, the crowd had an awesome time and the lighting show was nothing short of spectacular for the main event. The same criticism I'll always have, though, is that the first three songs ("three-songs-no-flash" being the standard clause for shooting) are still in the build up phase for lighting, and often music, and it would be nice to be able to get some of the songs later when the light and sound show peaks. Anyhow, enjoy.

More shots + commentary after the break.
