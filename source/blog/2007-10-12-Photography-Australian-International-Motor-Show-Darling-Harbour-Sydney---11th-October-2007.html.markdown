The day finally came where I was given the opportunity to be properly paid to cover an event. Alan Jones, editor and social media manager of News Limited's Cars Guide website, <a href="http://carsguide.com.au">CarsGuide.com.au</a>, contacted me wanting to get an alternate perspective on the Australian International Motor Show. Essentially, he wanted to get a rock photographers take on such an event. This was a pretty big chance for me, and a risk for Alan and I hope he thinks it has paid off.

I attended the morning session of the Media and Industry day at Darling Harbour on the 11th of October as a freelance photographer working for <a href="http://carsguide.com.au">CarsGuide.com.au</a>. On arrival we got our goody bag and breakfast before heading out, camera in hand, to play with the toys. Well, shoot them at least. I must admit it felt a little daunting being surrounded by professionals with twin Canon 1D cameras, Lowepro belts with additional lenses and a more flashes than you could care to imagine. For a person that rarely uses flash, mainly because I don't have an external unit, it has been interesting to look at the shots that others had taken. Also I realised post event that it would have been nice to have a second full frame camera with a Canon 16-35mm f/2.8 lens L on the front for the wide angle shots. Perhaps next year. Instead I had my trusty Canon 20D, my Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L and a brand new Canon 24-70mm f/2.8L lens, purchase to replace my Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 after some accident caused the front element to move in/out by 3mm on its own accord, making focus difficult in live situations.

The day was absolutely fantastic, running around trying to score the best positions, and so forth. Unfortunately I had a meeting to attend for my day job so I could only take a half day off. I headed back to work unable to upload the shots immediately. When I got home I spent the time getting shots up, and as they were uploaded I received the following message from Alan:
<blockquote> it was my idea to send a rock photographer to a motorshow but i didn't realise Joel would be this good

Definitely made me feel more comfortable about the work that I did for them. Despite issues getting the shots to the <a href="http://carsguide.com.au">CarsGuide.com.au</a> team, I finally managed (4 zips to ensure that they met the email limits of News Limited) and hopefully you'll see them sometime soon (probably on the <a href="http://carsguide.news.com.au/aims">event website</a>). Further shots will come this weekend as I head back, this time with the crowds, to get the shots I've missed - lots of the public inspecting the cars they can afford, and ogling over the cars that are beyond their means.

Once more a big thank you to Alan Jones and the team at <a href="http://carsguide.com.au">CarsGuide.com.au</a> for giving me the opportunity.
