<p style="text-align: center"><small><a href="http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/">Kanye West</a> headlining Good Vibrations and banishing photographers from his midst (well, at least the pit)</small></p>
My first major music festival in Sydney was <a href="http://www.goodvibrationsfestival.com.au/">Good Vibrations</a> held last weekend. Man, what a day. While I had the opportunity to shoot the <a href="http://www.bimbadgenblues.com.au/">Bimbadgen Blues Festival</a> in the Hunter during my final weekend as a Novocastrian, Good Vibes was about ten times bigger. Two major stages plus a few smaller ones, big international headliners (the rather pretentious Kanye "no-photographers-in-the-pits-because-I-can't-deal-with-my-own-popularity-but-have-a-mega-ego" West and Cypress Hill in the Roots tent) and plenty of Sydney's finest fluoro+electro loving kiddies made for a massive day.

Highlight of the day for me was catching up with the guys from Melbourne's Damn Arms (having shot them a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/1753047931/">few</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157601787365543/">times</a> before) and seeing Thievery Corporation - particularly one of their singers who was absolutely dreamy.

<h3><a href="http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/">Kanye West</a></h3>
Pretentious little prick didn't let us into the pit. Instead me, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mattbooy/">Matt Booy</a> (from TripleJ) and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/spinal_faun/">Ash</a> (shooting for an Aussie online "mag" called InTheMix, who I often shoot for) braved the crowds and ended up standing firm for 40-45 minutes to maintain our position. Anyhow, even from our pretty poor position, we got some good shots away :) (note to shooters, if they ban you from the pit and you brave the crowd, stay ~4 rows back so you're out of reach of security ;))

<h3><a href="http://thieverycorporation.com">Thievery Corporation</a></h3>
I love these guys - and the best thing was they had the full live compliment of muso's with them. One of the girls who sang was so unbelievably dreamy. When she walked out on stage the jaws of all the photographers in the pit, guys and girls, dropped - she was absolutely captivating. They've also got the coolest bass player. Ever.

<h3>The Crowd</h3>
A festival isn't complete without a record of the <em>munted punters</em> that are present. Of worthy mention are the two <em>triple-stack</em>s and the girl who was slightly confused between <a href="http://groovinthemoo.com">Groovin' the Moo</a> (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/2270495626/in/set-72157603917823836/">see the photo</a>) and <a href="http://www.goodvibrationsfestival.com.au/">Good Vibes</a> (see below). I'm normally fairly cautious about crowd shots - especially in venues - but with a festival, whenever people see a camera they're not shy in making it known that they want you to take their photo.

<h3>The Shooters</h3>
The day was spent with some of Sydney's best music photographers: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mattbooy/">Matt Booy</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dreadfuldan/">Dan Boud</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/spinal_faun/">Ashley</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/photo_assassins/">Anthony Yong</a>. Also present was News Limited's <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/charliebrewer/">Charlie Brewer</a>, who I first met almost a year ago at <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/05/02/eight-weeks-in-sunny-rainy-newcastle/">Semi-Permanent 2007</a> and have since bumped into a few times, such as at the <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/10/12/australian-international-motor-show-at-darling-harbour-sydney/">Australian International Motor Show</a> and the <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2008/02/24/cypress-hill-at-the-enmore-theatre/">Cypress Hill sideshow</a>.

<h3>What to bring when shooting?</h3>
I decided to upgrade my camera pack this year - and what better reason than a festival. I'll write my thoughts on my Crumpler The Whiskey &amp; Cox later, but needless to say a bag, a good broadbrim hat (especially as I burn so easily), long sleeve lightweight shirt (ditto), sunscreen, sunnies, water, some fruit and snacks, camera, fast telephoto, fast wide angle, plenty of cards, card dumping device. Then you'll be set :)
