Well, it had to happen... I've opened <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/">my account at flickr</a>. The main reason is that iPhoto has a plugin that allows me to directly upload to the flickr album. Now, if they could make a flickr type of system to install on any server, that worked with the plugin, it'd be a killer little app. Apparently<a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery2</a> can do it, so I'll have to look into it because I might be finally scrapping my own little gallery system I made last year as a procrastination tool...

Anyhow, only two 'test' shots are up atm...
