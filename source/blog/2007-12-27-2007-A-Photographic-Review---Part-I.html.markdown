I'm sure I'll set up some form of paging system, rather than a post, but till then this will do.

<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/archives/date-taken/2007/calendar/">2007</a> was a phenomenal year for me and my camera. I got off my arse and started shooting gigs bigger than ever. In a short six month period, while living in Newcastle, I shot local and international touring acts both up there and down in Sydney. Since then I've been getting more opportunities and requests to use my shots (and hopefully start paying back some money on the gear front - to all bands and touring companies, our gear doesn't come cheaply, so unless you're playing for free at the gigs I'm shooting, show some respect back to the photographers when you look at the contracts you have them often sign and realise that they must pay for their gear and training, just like you have to!). So without further ado, a month by month description of 2007 with photos.

So, read and look on!

<p style="text-align: center"><small>New Years Eve as viewed from McMahons Point</small></p>
January saw the year begin with a bang. I spent New Years Eve with some friends from uni at McMahons Point and then on to Manly to catch up with Charles+Kate and the rest of the Manly High guys.

There were also a few shots when the surf got good for the Billabong Junior Pro down at my home beach at North Narrabeen.

<h3><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/archives/date-taken/2007/02/calendar/">February</a></h3>
February was my last month in Sydney for half a year and was rather busy (as always ;)). This month saw me <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157594528525107/">head out to Petersham for Green Beats</a>, shoot Tom and Toby surfing at Manly, get up early to shoot sunrise over Long Reef - and sunset over Palm Beach, enjoy <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157594551444875/">the 2007 Tropfest extravaganza in the Domain</a> (and shot <a href="http://thebamboos.com/">The Bamboos</a> for the first time), attend <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/03/11/looking-for-line-national-art-school-22nd-february-2007/">Kate Butcher's art exhibition at the national art school</a> (along with some driving long exposure shots).

<h3><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/archives/date-taken/2007/03/">March</a></h3>
March was my first month in Newcastle, and also culminated in a rather large amount of driving. During the first weekend alone (including the Friday with an RDO) I headed up to Newcastle to briefly become acquainted with my new residence before heading back to Sydney and on down to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600009911812/">Jarvis Bay for my cousin's wedding</a> and then back up to Newcastle, via North Narrabeen and Haberfield, with Stu to move a bed and other random furniture into my new Newcastle abode then back to Sydney. I finally moved myself up more permanently on the Tuesday night, following two days of training for work. March also saw me <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600010001898/">climb down at the Narrabeen slabs with Jared, Lee and Heath</a>, shoot some absolutely stunning surf down at Bar Beach (one of the shots has ended in an Australian surf guide - first shot published in a book!), shoot both <a href="http://www.triplejunearthed.com/Artists/View.aspx?artistid=11385">Roger Explosion</a>'s <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600158450633/">EP Launch at Kings Cross's Candy's Appartment</a> and triplej unearthed j-award nominee <a href="http://triplejunearthed.destramusic.com/Artists/FeaturedArtist.aspx?artistid=2732">Cuthbert &amp; The Nightwalkers</a> as they supported Newcastle's <a href="http://www.triplejunearthed.com/Artists/View.aspx?artistid=2831">The Seabellies</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600027216299/">EP launch up in Newcastle at the Cambridge Hotel</a> and attend <a href="http://semipermanent.com/">SemiPermanent2007</a> at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600158412752/">the Convention Centre at Darling Harbour, Sydney</a>.

<h3><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/archives/date-taken/2007/04/">April</a></h3>
By April I had finally got most of my life moved up to Newcastle (well, the parts that I couldn't live without) and had a desk and a set of shelves and could actually live and work. After such a hectic March, April was a month of quiet times, so <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600164003968/">beyond a trip to Dudley</a> to shoot <a href="http://www.grantwalmsley.com/">Grant Walmsley</a> (one of my housemate Ben Lange's good friends) as he started out on the music circuit solo (following some quiet times during the post-Screaming Jets days) and rounding out the month with my first piece of contributor work for <a href="http://www.inthemix.com.au/">InTheMix</a> with <a href="http://www.inthemix.com.au/gallery/view.php?gid=13367&amp;url=/photos17/070427-lukefair">DJ Luke Fair hitting Newcastle</a> not much happened (although my mates did come up for a bit of a trip at easter to get away from Sydney and hit the wineries, to differing degrees of success).

I headed down to the carpark at the end of my street in Newcastle to shoot some sunsets - the colours were amazingly vivid in comparison with back on Sydney's Northern Beaches, owing mainly to the lack of high hills to the west. This month also saw the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600183183103/">24 hours of flickr</a>, participation in a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600196109034/">short-course on Earthing</a> through work (I was part of the Network Earthing group), an <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600196186702/">inspection of Newcastle's old Zone Sub</a> through <a href="http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/">Engineers Australia</a>, the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600199850903/comments/">beginnings of my art classes</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600205476725/">getting up way too early at South Curl Curl for a sunrise shoot</a>, another shoot for InTheMix - <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600217202627/">this time the classical-jazz-hiphop fusion of True Live at the Cambridge Hotel in Newcastle</a>, a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600224446103/">visit to a 132kV substation in Sydney for work</a>, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jufemaiz/sets/72157600186813131/">more trips to and from Newcastle/Sydney</a>. <em>Phew</em>!
