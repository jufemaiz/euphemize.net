Got invited to do the portrait shots for a friend from uni's boyfriend. He's plays brass and is an up and coming conductor.

We had to get up early to catch the nice sun down at north narrabeen, but got some good shots of the film (36 exposures of TMAX400 which I had developed and scanned by the good guys at photoking randwick).
