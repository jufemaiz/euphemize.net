so I leave in 20 minutes for the exciting location of sawtell for the long weekend. To all those who hate unions with a passion - you had better fucking well be at work on monday. To all else, enjoy labour day!

I'll be up at the remote location of Sawtell for the <a href="http://www.barneymillerclassic.com/">Barney Miller Classic surf comp</a> - supporting a mates band <a href="http://www.thelyricalmadmen.com">The Lyrical Madmen</a> as part of their rent-a-crowd [though we pay for the privelage - $110 for the bus and camping fee]. Hope it's not wet, and I get a bunch of awesome photos - and some uni work done at the same time. Anyway - see you in a few days...

oh yeah - forgot to say - foster you're a homo, and that hair is definitely bleached!
