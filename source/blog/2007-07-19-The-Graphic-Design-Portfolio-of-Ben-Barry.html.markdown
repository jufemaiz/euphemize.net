<p style="text-align: center"><small>The Graphic Design Portfolio of (the very very talented) Ben Barry (pay Ben a visit at <a href="http://designforfun.com/">designforfun.com</a>)</small></p>

The founder of the design forum <a href="http://theroot42.org">TheRoot42.org</a> Ben Barry has been let loose on the world and as such is seeking someone to employ him. His portfolio encompasses a large range of works - identity, art direction, photography, typography. You name it Ben probably has played with it. His most recent work has been on Project M that lead to <a href="http://buyameter.org/">buyameter.org</a> - an initiative to provide water meters to Alabama's poorest citizens and give them access to fresh water (for the full project <a href="http://designforfun.com/display.php?id=6">look on his site</a>).

I managed to give Ben a hand with some of the behaviour aspects of the site. Using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/"><acronym title="Yahoo! User Interface">YUI</acronym></a> library made things exceedingly simple, and I've since pushed this concept onto the <acronym title="Network Earthing Online">NEOn</acronym> project I've been undertaking at work.

I hope Ben lands a job soon that will see him fully utilised - his talent is immense. So pay Ben a visit at <a href="http://designforfun.com/">designforfun.com</a>.
