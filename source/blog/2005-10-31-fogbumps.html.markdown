This morning in sydney has been quite foggy, with the downpour of yesterday being evapourated by the lovely sun that has made its appearence early this year. As a result, bondi beach appeared like _pea soup_ for uge tan of <a href="http://aquabumps.com">aquabumps</a>.

Awesome shot of the day, despite the fog:
