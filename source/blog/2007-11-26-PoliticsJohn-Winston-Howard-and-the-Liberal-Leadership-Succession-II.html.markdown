<p style="text-align: center">John Winston Howard - the man who left the Liberals a shattered force</p>
This is a follow up to an <a href="http://euphemize.net/blog/archives/2007/09/12/john-winston-howard-and-the-liberal-leadership-succession/">earlier speculative article on the leadership succession</a> of the federal Liberal Party in Australia.

With the Liberal Party-National Party Coalition suffering an absolute routing at the Australian Federal Election on Saturday 24th November, and the now former Prime Minister suffering the ignominious honour of being only the second Prime Minister in the nation's history to lose his seat at an election (in addition to encumbancy for his party) the leadership of the former Government is in disarray. With no one at the helm to guide them, and no one able to until the results on some seats are in and people can select a new leader-deputy leader combo, the recriminations are flying. Commentators who previously couldn't ever say a bad word about the Prime Ministership of John Howard are now claiming that <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/if-only-hed-retired-gracefully/2007/11/26/1196036809908.html">there are long running faults</a>, the Business Council of Australia is <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/26/2100796.htm?section=justin">running around trying to rewrite their involvement in the past election campaign</a> to try and not be black listed by the incoming government (unlikely to happen in any event - Labor's not known in the past twenty years to do such a thing) and members of the party coming out claiming that they new this was going to happen but they couldn't affect any change inside the party (<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/libs-turn-on-howard/2007/11/26/1196036812217.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1">Nick Minchin and others I'm looking at you</a>).

Now that the dust is settling we can knock a few more off my initial list and whittle it down to the following potentials:
<ul>
	<li>Malcolm Turnbull</li>
	<li>Tony Abbott</li>
	<li>Dr Brendan Nelson</li>
	<li>Julie Bishop</li>
	<li>Chris Pyne</li>
	<li>Andrew Robb</li>
</ul>
Out of this I believe we can strike off Tony Abbott. Despite putting his hat into the ring, it's exceedingly unlikely he'll be given the leadership baton if the party actually wants to win any election, credibility or respect. This brings it down to the realistic options of Dr Brendan Nelson or Malcolm Turnbull. As I said in my thoughts previously, both have obstacles in their way, but I think Turnbull will take it - nobody trusts a traitor, even if he jumped ship to your side (that'd be Dr Nelson). Turnbull definitely brings an air of freshness to a party that needs a strong leader to give it direction - he's self made and doesn't need the job for an income or a retirement cash cow, so his judgements I believe will be less clouded by those concerns, and to date this is how he's acted - to the chagrin of the party. It is, however, this leadership and judgement that could provide the Liberals with someone to rally around - but the speedbump in these plans will be the factions. The other three, I believe, will jostle for the deputy leadership role.

On the leadership question, for once in my life <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/if-only-hed-retired-gracefully/2007/11/26/1196036809908.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1">I find myself agreeing</a> with Gerard Henderson, even if I do not like the politics of Julie Bishop one iota.
<blockquote>This time the Liberals would be well advised to give a Malcolm Turnbull-Julie Bishop leadership team a chance.</blockquote>
