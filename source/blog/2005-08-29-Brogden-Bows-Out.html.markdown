New South Wales Liberal leader (and my local member) has resigned following the surfacing of his racist slurs against Bob Carr's wife. He should also resign as local member for Pittwater in my opinion, but it seems racist politicians are given more second chances than others by the Australia population (see Pauline Hanson, John Howard etc).
