After decamping from Cord's place and relocating to my new digs - a hostel near Baron's Court - I jumped aboard the train to Manchester to meet up with Ruth and Adam, fellow members of <a href="http://theroot42.org">TheRoot42.org</a>, for a traditional Sunday Afternoon Roast, capped off with a couple of Coopers (had to introduce the poms to it!). What I hadn't counted on was that Manchester United was playing the same day, so my trip up and back with Virgin Trains meant that while I didn't have a seat, I had a lot of entertainment provided for me - from the Swedish teachers over for the weekend to get pissed and watch football, to the unhappy supporters of the losing side (not Manchester thankfully, otherwise I'm sure it would have been a far worse trip back!).

Monday I followed a similar path to Sunday as I headed out to Oxford to catch up with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fevrino1/">Fev</a> (also known as Heather). I met Fev first when her boyfriend Mark (and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markhaldane/">fellow photographer</a> and member of <a href="http://theroot42.org">TheRoot42.org</a>) were in Australia doing work experience as geologists up at Mount Isa and visited Sydney. Fev grew up in Oxfordshire and offered to show me around the area as Mark was out in a remote area of <del>Wales</del><ins>Cornwall</ins> doing a dig with uni.

Oxford was crazy cool, filled with all those images of olde Universities that Australia can never replicate. The town itself was dominated by bicycles and the tours around places like the Bodleian Library, Radcliffe Camera and Christ Church College provided an insight into a totally different type of life. For the fans of Harry Potter, much of the scenes were (are?) filmed around the grounds of Oxford, including the Hall of Christ Church College.
