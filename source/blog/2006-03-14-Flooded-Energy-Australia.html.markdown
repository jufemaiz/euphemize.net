We had a little incident at work today. By little, the results were that the entire 24 storey building from around midday. It turns out that a water main on level four decided to break and water gushed everywhere. The floors below were quite quickly evacuated, due to the water running with gravity. Upper floors were allowed to stay, though the lifts were not working. I decided to go have lunch with friends from the 3rd floor. When I came out there were already a couple of fire trucks waiting outside, water pouring out of the elevators (evidently the shafts are the lowest points on each floor) and also out the building onto the footpath outside.

After lunch I tried to get back in, but we were completely shut out - a full evacuation had taken place. Unfortunately my laptop was still upstairs on level 9 so I had to kill time for about 2 more hours before we met up at Hyde Park to find out if/when we could get our stuff today. Turns out we could - but only 2 people per floor... With police escort (poor buggers had to do 8 trips up and down all the way to the 24th floor).

Although I had hoped not to have to go to work tomorrow, I'll have to arrive between 8:30am and 9am to get in... Looks like it'll be 'fun' nonetheless.
