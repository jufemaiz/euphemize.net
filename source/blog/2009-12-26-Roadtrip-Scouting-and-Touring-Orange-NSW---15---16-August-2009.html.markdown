<div class="caption">Nadine + Andrew (and the "kids") @ Orange, NSW - 16 August, 2009</div>

I was up in rural NSW (~3.5hrs from Sydney) to scout locations for Nadine and Andrew's wedding - a couple of friends living in Orange. I also spent the time helping a them get used to being in front of the lens.

The ceremony was held in Milthorpe, with photos taken around Orange's parks, vineyards and orchards.

A Ferrari run was evidently on this weekend, stopping in at nearby Milthorpe. Couldn't resist this old school Dino.
