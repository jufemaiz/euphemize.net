<h3>Keynote Address: Developments in the International Electricity Supply Industry <small>Scott Rouse, Managing Partner</small></h3>
Scott Rouse was invited by the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/"><acronym title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">IEEE</acronym></a> to speak at the conference. He is a Managing Partner at <a href="http://www.energy-efficiency.com">Energy @ Work</a> in Canada.

<p style="text-align: center"><small>Scott Rouse, Managing Partner Energy @ Work, Canada</small></p>
Rouse spoke of the experiences of the Canadian Province of Ontario as it undertook a deregulation of the electricity industry, the market, and beyond. His key points were on energy efficiency.
<h3>Energy Supply to <acronym title="New South Wales">NSW</acronym> - History, Challenges and The Future</h3>
In the wake of the release of the much anticipated Owen Report into the New South Wales electricity industry, the panel that was invited to discuss the above topic was an interesting combination of heavy hitters from the industry.
<ol>
	<li>Geoff Lilliss, Executive General Manager, Network, EnergyAustralia</li>
	<li>Richard Power, Chief Executive Officer, Integral Energy</li>
	<li>Jim Henness, Chief Executive Officer, Delta Energy</li>
	<li>Peter McIntyre, Chief Executive Officer, Delta Energy</li>
	<li>Mark Miller, General Manager, <acronym title="National Electricity Market Management Company">NEMMCO</acronym></li>
</ol>
<h4>Geoff Lilliss, EnergyAustralia</h4>
Geoff Lillis provided an overview of EnergyAustralia detailing the separation of the partly regulated Retail arm and the fully regulated Network arm. Interestingly, although unspurprisingly given Lilliss' role within Network, no comment was forthcoming on the potential for sale of the retail arm.

<h5>History</h5>
Lilliss provided a backdrop in the changes to regulation in the industry. Since the first electrical system was started in Tamworth for lighting we have seen the following progression of regulation and accountability:
<ul>
	<li>Agreements for each County Council</li>
	<li>Performance Agreements with the Minister</li>
	<li><acronym title="Independent Pricing And Regulatory Tribunal">IPART</acronym> (distribution) + <acronym title="Australian Competition and Consumer Commission">ACCC</acronym> (transmission)</li>
	<li><acronym title="Australian Energy Regulator">AER</acronym></li>
</ul>
The lumpiness of the investment cycles was noted, of interest to some will be that this cycle is similar to many first world nations and thus the issues that the New South Wales electricity industry, and Australia more generally as a whole, is facing. The industry saw a mammoth asset investment period from 1962 to as late as 1984 as the nation was literally electrified. Unlike today, investment in the industry during this period was done under the notion of socialist service provision, regardless of the party that was in power. With little investment from the early eighties to the late nineties, and the retirement age of much of the assets that were built during the initial investment period fast approaching, we will be seeing even larger investment required as we retire old assets and cope with the growth in load. A statistic to note is that 41% of assets built 1962 to 1977.

Part of the problem with our current investment is the differential in growth between peak demand and energy. Peak demand drives investment in all aspects of the industry, but the financial return is really only seen in the energy, leaving assets with potentially very low utilisation factors. The growth in load for EnergyAustralia has been estimated at 170<abbr title="Mega Volt">MV</abbr> (3-4 zone subs) per year, while the Sydney Inner Metro area alone has average system growth of ~100<abbr title="Mega Volt-Amp">MVA</abbr> - the equivalent of a new TransGrid supply point every 6 years.
<h5>Challenges</h5>
Worldwide trends. Electricity infrastructure - key findings. Electricity supply is taken for granted. Cities at all levels face a challenge in keeping up with rising demand. Environmental impact is a major consideration. Stakeholders will emphasize renewable sources for the future as much as fossil fuels.

The Regulatory Environment imposes significant challenges due to the changes that have occurred not only in the past decade but also with the formation of the Australian Energy Regulator. The current regulatory oversight is provided by:
<ul>
	<li><acronym>MCE</acronym> (Ministerial Council on Energy) - energy policy body;</li>
	<li><acronym>Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC)</acronym> - rule making body; and</li>
	<li>Australian Energy Regulator (AER) - economic regulator.</li>
</ul>
Of significant concern to those in the Distribution sector is that the AER (and previously the ACCC) has had no background in the area and thus there is the potential for a poorly created framework. Additionally core elements of the Regulatory Framework are still to be finalised including the scope of regulation &amp; level of discretion.

EnergyAustralia's Capital Investment Program will grow to $AU~1Billion per year by financial year  2016/2017. Resourcing has come to the floor as the global industry has grown in addition to the retirement of older engineers we see a lack of investment in business knowledge and lack of middle aged engineers further hampering the problems. To add to this has been the extreme commodity price fluctuations that we have seen in Copper, Aluminium and Steel. These resources have all had cost increases far above CPI (ABS) over the past few years, particularly accelerating during the last 12 months.
<h5>Summary</h5>
The concept of automation within the network, with real customer benefits, will become a reality in the near future. However, as with everything, someone has to pay. This is compounded by the huge replacement and expansion program being undertaken to meet the growth in energy, but significantly more so in the demand being placed on the network.
